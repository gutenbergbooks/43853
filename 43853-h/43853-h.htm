<h1 title="">THE GALLOPING GHOST</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">CHAPTER I</span>
<br />KIDNAPER&rsquo;S ISLAND</h2>
<p>Red Rodgers rolled half over, squirmed
about, then sat up. For a long time he
had felt the floor beneath him vibrate with the
throb of powerful motors. His eardrums,
beaten upon as they had been by the roar of
those motors, now seemed incapable of registering
sound.</p>
<p>Not the slightest murmur suggesting life
reached his ears. &ldquo;Not the rustle of a leaf, nor
the lap of a tiny wave; not the whisper of a
village child asleep,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Can I
have gone stone deaf?&rdquo; Cold perspiration
started out upon the tip of his nose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>And then, piercing the silence like a siren&rsquo;s
scream in the night, came a wild, weird, mad,
hilarious laugh.</p>
<p>Startled by this sudden shock of sound, he
shuddered from head to foot. Then, at once,
he felt better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least I am not deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That laugh,&rdquo; he mused a moment later, &ldquo;it
was almost human, but not quite. What could
it have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question he could form no answer.
The wild places, wilderness, forest, lakes, rivers,
were sealed books to Red. He had lived
his life in a city, lived strenuously and with
a purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some wild thing,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;But
where am I?&rdquo; His brow wrinkled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
kidnaped, dragged from my berth in a sleeping
car, thrown into a speed boat, carried
miles down a river, bundled into this airplane,
whirled for hours through the air, and landed
here. But where is here? And why am I here
at all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hours,&rdquo; he whispered slowly. A stray
moonbeam lighted a spot on his knee. He
placed his wrist there and read the dial of his
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, hours. It&rsquo;s five after midnight. And
to-morrow, hundreds of miles away, I was to
have made at least two touchdowns. The
crowd would expect at least one sixty-yard
dash by the Red Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rover.&rdquo; That was the name the
fans had given him. Well, the Red Rover
would not run. He smiled grimly. But, after
all, what did it matter? They were to play
Woodville. What was Woodville? A weak
team. Old Midway&rsquo;s cubs could beat them.
It was a midweek game, mainly for practice.
He wasn&rsquo;t needed for that. But Saturday&rsquo;s
game! Ah, well, that was another story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But kidnaped!&rdquo; He brought himself up
with a start. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been kidnaped! Dragged
from my berth. Whirled all the way to some
place where wild creatures laugh at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>Kidnaped. The whole affair seemed absurd
to him. He had read of kidnapings. There had
been many of late. It had always made his
blood boil when some innocent child, some
helpless woman had been carried away to a
dismal hole and held for ransom. &ldquo;Low-lived
curs,&rdquo; he had called the kidnapers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ransom!&rdquo; He laughed a low laugh. He
was a college student, a football player for two
months of the year, a night clerk in a hotel
the rest of the year, an orphan boy working
his way through the university. He thought
there were three dollars in his pocket, but he
could not be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnaped! Must have got the wrong fellow
this time. Tell &rsquo;em who I am, and they&rsquo;ll
turn me loose; hustle me back, like as not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was wrong. They would neither turn
him loose nor hustle him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Red. You can get out.&rdquo; These
words were spoken as the airplane door swung
open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red!&rdquo; the boy thought with a start. &ldquo;So
they <i>do</i> know who I am. They did mean to
get me. I wonder why!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; he whistled as a cold breeze struck
his cheek. &ldquo;Cold up here.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cold enough,&rdquo; the other grumbled. &ldquo;Come
on, shake a leg! This boat swings about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s strange how a single word tells
a long story. The whiff of cold air had told
him that they had flown north. Now he knew
that they had landed on water. But what
water? And where?</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are.&rdquo; A hand in the moonlight
guided him to a seat in the stern of a small
boat.</p>
<p>Red opened his eyes wide at the scene that
lay before him, a broad, deep bay fringed by
a black ribbon of spruce and balsam. The
moonlight, forming a path of gold across the
water, fell upon some dark object. As the oars
of the boat creaked, the dark object made a
splashing sound; it moved.</p>
<p>As if reading the boy&rsquo;s thoughts, the oarsman
ceased his labors to cast the circle of a
powerful flashlight in the direction of the moving
creature.</p>
<p>With a quick intake of breath Red stared
enchanted; for there, not twenty yards away,
standing at the end of the small island which
he had reached at this moment, was a moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>Nowhere in all his life had the boy beheld
such complete majesty. Erect, silent, powerful,
the monarch of the forest stood there defiant
and unafraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in all the earth could one find a spot
such as this?&rdquo; Red breathed to himself. &ldquo;A
spot so sheltered that even the shyest of the
forest&rsquo;s great ones shows no fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had expected the oarsman to drag a
rifle from the prow and fire point-blank at this
moose. Instead, he sat there for a second, his
rough face disfigured by a semblance of a
smile; then, pocketing his flashlight, he once
again took up his oars.</p>
<p>For Red there was little enough time for
thought. The boat swung about. Before them
lay a point of land, perhaps the end of an
island. At its extreme end was a little half-clearing
where a score of girdled birches pointed
their barren trunks, like dead fingers, toward
the sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>At the edge of this clearing was a small log
cabin. From this a pale light gleamed. Toward
this cabin the boat directed its course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the forest primeval.&rsquo;&rdquo; The words
sprang unbidden to the boy&rsquo;s lips. &ldquo;&lsquo;The murmuring
pines and the hemlocks, bearded with
moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the
twilight, stand like Druids of eld, with voices
sad and prophetic, stand like harpers hoar,
with beards that rest on their bosoms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow was to have been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he closed his eyes he saw what it was to
have been: a wild, shouting throng; college
songs, college yells, bands, waving banners.
&ldquo;Go, Midway! Go!&rdquo; Two squads battling for
victory. Wild scrambles. Futile dashes. And,
with good fortune, a mad dash of fifty yards
to triumphal victory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boat bumped. A narrow landing lay beside
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get off here.&rdquo; There was something
impersonal in the tone of this strange pilot
of the night. &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be home for you, son,
for quite some considerable time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; Red thought.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The room he entered a moment later was
small and very narrow. In one corner was a
cot, in another a table and chair. Across from
the table was a curious affair of sheet iron
that, he guessed, might be a stove. The place
was agreeably warm. There must be a small
fire. On the table a candle burned.</p>
<p>Turning about to seek for an explanation of
all that had been happening and of his strange
surroundings, he was not a little startled to
find himself alone. The door had been silently
closed behind him. And locked? Well, perhaps.
What could it matter? He was, beyond
doubt, surrounded by water, the merciless
water of the north country&mdash;some north country
in November; surrounded, too, by determined
men, hostile men, perhaps, who had apparently
ordained that his stay in the cabin
should be a long one. Once again, as he
dropped into the chair, there came to his mind
that forceful interrogation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before, he could form no adequate answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>His mind was busy with this problem when,
with startling suddenness, his attention was
caught and held by the low sound of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you signed?&rdquo; It was a man who
spoke. The voice was not gruff; a low, smooth,
persuasive voice, too smooth, too persuasive.</p>
<p>Quite in contrast was the answer. Unmistakably
feminine, it came sharp and crisp as
the crash of icicles fallen from the eaves. &ldquo;I
will never sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But consider.&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice was not
raised, still smooth, persuasive. &ldquo;You are on
an island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An island. I thought so,&rdquo; Red whispered
to himself. &ldquo;But who can this girl be?&rdquo; That
the one beyond the partition was a girl he did
not doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never sign!&rdquo; the girl broke in upon
the other&rsquo;s oily speech. &ldquo;My father owes you
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Consider,&rdquo; the other persisted. &ldquo;You are
on a narrow island within a bay. The water
of the bay is icy cold. You might swim it in
safety, though I doubt it. Should you succeed,
it would be but to find yourself upon a much
larger island. That island is fifteen miles from
the nearest mainland, a hundred from the farthest.
Can you swim that, or row it even if
you should find a boat? Ah, no. The waters
of this great lake are terrible in their fury.
And Superior never gives up her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so sepulchral about
these last words that the listening boy shuddered
in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On such an island there are people.&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s tone was stubborn, defiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one.&rdquo; The tone of the speaker
carried conviction. &ldquo;In summer, yes. In winter,
no. We are here alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;I shall stay here until
summer comes. Winter will soon be here.
And &lsquo;if winter comes,&rsquo;&rdquo; she quoted, &ldquo;&lsquo;can
spring be far behind?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a quiet cadence in the speaker&rsquo;s
tone that sent chills coursing up Red Rodger&rsquo;s
spine. At the same time he hardly suppressed
a desire to shout: &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; to the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>The closing of a door some seconds later
told him that this was a cabin of at least two
rooms and, strangely enough, between these
rooms was no connecting door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER II</span>
<br />WHISPERS IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>As Red Rodgers stretched his feet out before
the tiny stove in his narrow room,
his brow wrinkled. Here was a situation for
you! A football game to be played to-morrow
four or five hundred miles away. He laughed
a silent, mirthless laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football,&rdquo; he whispered. He was surprised
to find within his being a certain feeling of relief.
He relaxed to the very tips of his toes.
&ldquo;Football.&rdquo; He had seen a lot of it. Too much.
This was his first year on the varsity. Almost
without willing it, or even realizing it, he had
become the central attraction of his team. He
was the hub about which the offense circled.
His had been the power and the glory, the
power to dash and beat, weave and wind his
way to many a touchdown, the glory of the
victor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The power and the glory.&rdquo; Little enough
Red cared for glory. But power? Ah, yes!
All his life he had striven for power, physical
power for the most part. But he meant in the
end to go forward, to succeed in life.</p>
<p>Born and raised in a city of mills, he had,
from the age of fourteen, played his little part
in the making of steel. For three summers
and at every other available hour he had toiled
at steel. Bare to the waist, brown, heat-burned,
perspiring, he had dragged at long
bars, raking away at steel bars, but recently
formed by rushing, crashing rollers, that were
still smoking hot. Other hours he had spent
on the gridiron. The one helped the other.
Struggling with steel, he had become like steel
himself, hard, elastic, resisting. As he went
down the field men were repelled from his
Robot-like body as they might had he been a
thing of white-hot metal.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>And then had come his great opportunity.
A quiet, solidly built man, with wrinkled face,
bright eyes and tangled hair, had watched his
high school football exploits from the sidelines.
From time to time he had beckoned and
had whispered: &ldquo;Hold the ball closer to your
body. Lean. Lean far over. Don&rsquo;t run for the
sidelines. Break your way through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been an air of authority and
knowledge not to be questioned about this old
man. Red had listened and had tried to follow
the other&rsquo;s teaching.</p>
<p>Then, one day during his senior year at
Central High the old man had touched him on
the arm and had pronounced magical words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The university will need you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red had thrilled at these words. He knew
now, on the instant, that this was the &ldquo;Grand
Old Man&rdquo; of football, the fairest, squarest
coach that ever lived.</p>
<p>It had been good to know that the university
would need him, for long ago he had learned
that in his upward climb he would need the
university. The university had found him.
He had found the university. In his freshman
year, a cub, there had been bitter days and
hours of triumph. But why think of all that?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>With a restless motion he rose, took three
steps, the extent of his cabin, retraced them
and sat down. &ldquo;Like a beast in a cage!&rdquo; he
muttered low. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not stand it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought soberly: &ldquo;No, this is not to be
endured. Better the hard grind of football.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this girl in that other log-walled prison
cell? His mind did a sudden flip-flop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s rich,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;At least her father
is. That crook said he was. She did not deny
it.&rdquo; Red did not approve of rich people. They
had too much, others too little. He thought
still less of their children. It mattered little
to him that the sons and daughters of certain
rich men had endeavored to make friends with
him since his success at football. He could not
understand them, was puzzled by their ways,
and wished quite sincerely that they would
leave him alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soft,&rdquo; he had said to his roommate, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
what they are. No experiences worth having.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this girl over there beyond the log
wall,&rdquo; he said to himself now, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s different.
Got spunk. Stands up and defies them, she
does, when she knows they are beasts, as all
kidnapers are. Tells &rsquo;em she&rsquo;ll freeze here all
winter rather than do the thing they want her
to do. Nerve, that&rsquo;s what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was conscious of an invisible bond that
bound his life to that of the girl. &ldquo;In the end
we may fight it out together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hour was late. Once again the drowsy
warmth of this narrow cell settled down upon
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Football,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;A tough business.
Thousands screaming their lungs out, ten,
twenty, thirty, forty thousand people losing
their heads while you must keep yours. Wish
this were the end, wish it were all over.
Wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again, in the twinkling of an eye, his
mood changed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; he muttered beneath his
breath, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to get away!&rdquo; Leaping to
his feet, he stood there, hard, straight, square,
with purpose written in every line of his well
formed body. &ldquo;To-morrow&rsquo;s game, that is
nothing. But Saturday&rsquo;s game, that is everything.
It is the end. Final, that&rsquo;s what it is.
Defeat or victory, that&rsquo;s what it means. The
championship or nothing. And Prang, the
Grand Old Man, says it depends on us!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means me!&rdquo; There came a stoop to
his shoulders as if a load had fallen upon them.
&ldquo;For the Grand Old Man, for the school that
gave me a chance, for my mother, for clean
sport all over the world, I must escape. I must
play. I must win. I must! Must! <i>Must!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet, even as these words formed themselves
into thought he seemed to hear others. &ldquo;On
a narrow island within a bay. Icy water. Another
larger island. Fifteen, seventy-five, a
hundred miles from shore. Superior never gives
up her dead.&rdquo; Of a sudden the boy cursed the
school days when he had neglected his study
of geography. He saw it all now. Geography
was travel. And how could one find travel
dull?</p>
<p>&ldquo;But travel!&rdquo; Again that silent, mirthless
laugh. &ldquo;Who expects to travel as I have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were not finished. From somewhere
had come a long, low, hissing sound.
It was followed by a whisper:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over here! Come close to the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be that girl.&rdquo; His heart skipped a
beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did they take you for?&rdquo; the whisper
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that a great silence settled over the
place. This Red could not understand. Why
had she started the conversation if she did not
expect to finish it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he told himself at last, &ldquo;girls are
queer anyway.&rdquo; He settled back comfortably
in his place.</p>
<p>Truth was, the girl suspected him of being
a decoy placed there by the kidnapers. In the
end she came to see that she had little to lose
if she confided in a decoy.</p>
<p>Again came her long-drawn signal, demanding
attention. And after that:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you want to escape?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Never wanted anything half so much in
my life!&rdquo; Then in a sudden burst of confidence
he told her of the game that was to be on Saturday,
of the veteran coach&rsquo;s fatherly interest
in his career, of his hopes, his fears, his secret
ambitions. All this he poured into a not unwilling
ear. Only he did not tell her he was
the far-famed &ldquo;Red Rover.&rdquo; This he reserved
for the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed, still in a whisper.
&ldquo;Then our purposes are one. We must
join hands. Put her there! Shake on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This, considering that a log wall eight inches
thick lay between them, was of course impossible.
But they pledged themselves in pantomime.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER III</span>
<br />&ldquo;WE MUST ESCAPE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&ldquo;We must find some way of escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s tone, low, mellow, earnest,
was scarcely more than a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we are upon an island within an island.
Or did that man lie to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do but one thing at a time. We
must escape. And after that&mdash;&rdquo; She did not
finish.</p>
<p>The boy found it difficult, this discussing
plans with one he could not see, had never
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could soon cut a small hole between two
logs,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He thought of suggesting this, but considered
it better to wait.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>He set about planning their escape methodically.
The staple that held the padlock to
his door was large. It was clinched on the inside.
By working first with a nail pulled out
of the wall, then a bit of wire, he managed to
straighten these points. Then, little by little,
without sound, he pushed the staple back until
only the points showed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three good yanks and the door will
fly open,&rdquo; he confided to the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mine? How are we to manage it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red pondered this problem. He could, he
told himself, pass his crude instruments
through to her. But were her fingers strong
enough for the task? He doubted this.</p>
<p>He studied the wall that lay between them.
He was at a loss to account for this wall, which
had, from all appearances, stood there for
some years. Then it occurred to him that a
trapper had built the cabin, using one room for
himself, the other for his dogs. Campers of a
later date had doubtless cleared up the dogs&rsquo;
kennel and made a bunk room of it without
removing the partition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But this partition,&rdquo; he whispered excitedly,
&ldquo;is not notched into the cabin wall. The
logs were merely laid up, one upon another,
then a white birch pole spiked in each corner
to hold them into position. Once the poles are
removed, the logs may be taken down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; the girl breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your room will be mine and mine yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until they discover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will not discover. We will not remove
the logs until the hour set for our escape.
When they discover the cage door open,
the birds will have flown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was with strangely mixed feelings that
Red began the task of removing the white
birch poles which held the logs in place. Until
that moment the girl had seemed quite remote,
one living in another world, a rich man&rsquo;s
daughter. But as the last spike yielded and
the last pole stood leaning lightly in its place,
as he realized that the logs that lay between
them could be removed as easily as stones are
piled or grain shocked, he became conscious
of a new sort of comradeship such as he had
experienced with none other.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We are in for it,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;for better
or for worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For better or for worse,&rdquo; came the girl&rsquo;s
faint answer. &ldquo;And, oh, I&rsquo;m sure it is for better
than we dare dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one thing could be truly good: to get
back to Soldiers&rsquo; Field on time.&rdquo; Red thought
this, but he did not say it.</p>
<p>With the preparations all made there remained
but to wait. To one of Red&rsquo;s nature,
this was hardest of all. He was ever for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must wait,&rdquo; he said to the log wall
before him, in tones loud enough for the girl&rsquo;s
ears. &ldquo;The guard will be on the alert early in
the night. Later he will relax his vigil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. We must wait!&rdquo; came from the
other side of the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m putting out my light, retiring for the
night.&rdquo; These words, ending in a subdued
laugh, came from behind the wall half an hour
later, telling Red that for the eyes of the guard
she had retired for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Retired for the night,&rdquo; Red thought soberly.
&ldquo;Wonder when we will retire, and where?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>As he thought of the cold black waters of
this inland bay, a mental picture of his own
form, lying ten fathoms deep where the fishes
play, came to him. He saw his hands waved
about by the currents. Then with a shudder
he shook himself free from the illusion.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later he too &ldquo;retired for the
night.&rdquo; After that, with the cabin shrouded
in darkness, he sat and listened to the sounds
of the night.</p>
<p>Curious sounds they were to one who knew
nothing of wild life; the shrill, long-drawn
whistle of some bird calling to his mate; the
throaty call of a bull moose from down the
bay, and that piercing scream of the loon, never
failing to set his blood running cold.</p>
<p>He thought he caught the sound of footsteps.
The guard! What if he appeared and
discovered all that had been done? He listened
long for a rattle at the lock, but none
came.</p>
<p>At last, standing erect, he stretched himself
like a cat, then said in a hoarse whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking down the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>In absolute silence he lifted the birch poles
from their places. He put a hand to the topmost
log. It did not yield to his pull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spiked on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried the second one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It came away. Without a sound he placed
it at his feet. A second, a third, fourth, fifth.
Still no sound.</p>
<p>An opening three feet wide now lay before
him. He put out a hand. It touched some one.
Groping about, he found the girl&rsquo;s hand, then
guided her through the opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I have never
seen this person. Is she dark or fair, beautiful
or ugly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One or two things he could know. She was
short and rather plump. Her muscles were
hard. He was surprised at this. He had supposed
that rich men&rsquo;s daughters were always
soft and white.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>He drew the girl to a place on the bench
beside him. She was trembling. As her shoulder
pressed against his, he felt the wild beating
of her heart. This would never do. She
must be calm.</p>
<p>As for his own feelings, he had gone cold
all over, just as he had at the beginning of
every gridiron battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Warm enough when time comes for action,&rdquo;
he told himself. It had always been that
way.</p>
<p>The time for action had not yet come. They
continued to listen there in the dark; a boy
and a girl; the girl kidnaped for ransom which
she refused to assist in collecting, the boy carried
away and held for he knew not what.</p>
<p>The ticking of their watches sounded loud
in this lonely place. Water lapped on the
shore. From time to time there came a low
bump-bump.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rowboat tied to the dock,&rdquo; Red whispered
to the girl. &ldquo;Wonder if we could get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no reply.</p>
<p>From somewhere back in the forest a hoot
owl began his silly noise. Red did not know
what it was. He asked the girl about it. She
explained briefly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hope he keeps it up,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;Cover
up any little nasty sounds we may stir up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will there be noises?&rdquo; The girl seemed
to shrink. Then suddenly her form stiffened.
&ldquo;Count me in on&mdash;on anything. They are dirty
dogs, these kidnapers; deserve the worst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the very worst!&rdquo; Red agreed.</p>
<p>He felt loath to leave this place of warmth
and momentary peace. There was something
altogether agreeable about being so near to
this girl he had never seen. &ldquo;Well, the zero
hour approaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s make
it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose to stand beside her. So for one full
moment, side by side in the dark, they stood.</p>
<p>At last, with a long-drawn sigh, he seized
her hand to lead her out into the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER IV</span>
<br />THE GHOST APPEARS</h2>
<p>The mysterious disappearance of Red
Rodgers, or the Red Rover, as every one
knew him, caused a great commotion. Had a
President been assassinated it could not have
caused a greater stir.</p>
<p>Not an hour had passed after he vanished
before the newspapers came out with an extra
with a story telling in detail all that was known
about the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Rover,&rdquo; the story ran, &ldquo;has never
cared for crowds. Being the star of the team,
he has often of late been all but mobbed by
impetuous youths, foolish old women and infatuated
girls. For this reason he had formed
a friendship with the watchman at the tracks
by the river where the trains are made up.
To-night, once safely past this watchman, he
went directly to his berth and turned in for
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be assumed that he fell asleep at
once, for, though the watchman was not two
hundred yards away, he heard no outcry such
as might be expected had the boy been surprised
while asleep and gagged before fully
awake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are few clues,&rdquo; the story went on to
state. &ldquo;In their haste the kidnapers dragged
a pillow from the berth. It was this pillow,
standing out white in the moonlight, that attracted
the watchman&rsquo;s attention. The watchman
distinctly recalls hearing the sudden whir
and thunder of a powerful motor shortly before
making this discovery. He believes this
to have been the motor of a speed boat, and
has the impression that it went south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Various motives have been brought forward.
The Rover, some say, was kidnaped for
ransom. He is the all-important factor in the
game to be played at the end of the week.
Without him Old Midway cannot hope to win.
For this reason the kidnapers may have believed
that a sum might be extorted from officials
of the university for his return. Knowing
the stand that President Lovell of Old
Midway has taken against kidnapers, and the
work the Crime Institute of that university
has done in this connection, it is the opinion
of those close to the president that no ransom
will be paid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have before us the question: Was the
Red Rover kidnaped for ransom or as a retaliation
for work against master criminals
carried on by the university? There are those
who will whisper that the school against whom
the Red Rover was to have played is behind
this affair. This, to any fair-minded person, is
unthinkable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sergeants Drew Lane and Tom Howe, two
of the keenest young minds of the city&rsquo;s detective
force, have been assigned to the case.
It is the hope of the entire city that their labors
will bear fruit and that the Red Rover&rsquo;s beloved
sorrel top will be seen in the line when
the line-up is formed for the greatest game of
the year.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>An hour had not passed after the discovery
of the crime, when the broad-shouldered, athletic
Drew Lane, with derby pushed well back
on his head, stood beside his slim, hawk-nosed
partner overlooking the car yards at the spot
where the Red Rover had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look inside the car,&rdquo; suggested
Howe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look.&rdquo; Drew Lane turned toward the
river. &ldquo;If a speed boat left the river near this
spot, there&rsquo;ll be marks to show. May get a
sure tip showing the direction she was headed.
That&rsquo;s important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sergeant Howe swung up to the platform of
the car, then slipped quietly inside. The place
seemed deserted. A double row of curtains,
one on either side, flanked the narrow, dimly
lighted aisle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready for the night. All the other players
get on at the depot, I suppose,&rdquo; Howe mumbled
in a low monotone.</p>
<p>He paused to look and listen. He had always
found a sleeping car, made up for the night, a
spooky affair. Dim lights, silence, long rows
of curtains. And behind the curtains, what?
Death? Perhaps. Men have died of heart disease
in their berths. Died of a knife in the
heart as well.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Capital place for a murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Involuntarily he looked behind him. Had
he caught the sound of light footsteps?</p>
<p>There was no one in sight. &ldquo;Boo! Who&rsquo;d
bother to bump off a city detective!&rdquo; He
laughed a low, unpleasant laugh. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re supposed
to be too dumb to do anything disturbing
to criminals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same!&rdquo; He straightened up with a
snap. &ldquo;This is a case where we <i>must</i> win. We
simply <i>must</i>! The Red Rover must be in the
line-up when the big day comes. And it&rsquo;s up
to Drew and me!&rdquo; Howe was a loyal son of
Old Midway. Loyalty to his Alma Mater compelled
him to do his best. More than that, Red
Rodgers was the type he admired, a silent
worker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He works,&rdquo; Drew Lane had said once, with
a note of admiration in his voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s like
you, Howe. He digs in and says never a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Digs in,&rdquo; Howe muttered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what
we must do; dig in hard.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>With that he went gliding down the aisle
to pause before Section Nine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he breathed as he parted the curtains.
&ldquo;Seems I am in time. Nothing disturbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His keen, hawk-like eyes took in all at a
glance. The hammock, where clothing was deposited
for the night, was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just yanked it down and took it, clothes
and all. You might think from that that Red
had something they wanted in his clothes.
Guess not, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes wandered from corner to corner of
the narrow space. &ldquo;Covers gone. Wrapped
him in them and tied him up. Need to do that.
Scrapper, Red is. Take six of those soft, beer-soaked
bums to hold him if he had an even
break. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to stare at the center of the
lower sheet which still remained on the bed.
At its very center was a deep dent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stepped there,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;one of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Switching on his flashlight, he examined the
sheet in minute detail.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a mark,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Take it along
all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You all goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; take that sheet?&rdquo; The porter
was at his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure am.&rdquo; Howe showed his star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Mister Police. Ah cain&rsquo;t stop you.
But t&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t no sort of use. Ain&rsquo;t no marks on
that sheet. I examined it particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you here when the thing happened?&rdquo;
Howe&rsquo;s eagle eyes snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Oh, no, suh! Ah don&rsquo;t come on &rsquo;fore
half a hour ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you weren&rsquo;t far away,&rdquo; Howe thought
to himself. &ldquo;Hiding in the linen closet, like as
not. Bribed you, maybe. Wonder how much
it would cost to buy a porter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your number?&rdquo; he demanded
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three twenty-seven.&rdquo; The porter&rsquo;s wide
eyes rolled. &ldquo;But hones&rsquo;, Mister Policeman, I
don&rsquo; know nothin&rsquo;, nothin&rsquo; at all! But you
take that sheet, just take it right square along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find something, Sergeant?&rdquo; a
fresh voice broke in.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just a sheet that had been stepped on.&rdquo;
Howe looked into the frank, fearless eyes of
a boy. It was Johnny Thompson. You know
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; Howe muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to see
you! Are you in this with us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my heart and hand!&rdquo; The hand Johnny
gave to Howe was as hard as a rock. &ldquo;This
will be a night and day affair. I&rsquo;m glad.
That&rsquo;s the sort I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Day and night and all the time,&rdquo; Howe
answered. &ldquo;But let&rsquo;s get out of here. The
section is due to move, and I&rsquo;ve finished.
Drew&rsquo;s scouting around down by the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, while the forces that make for evil
had been whirling Red Rodgers northward,
the forces that make for good, like faithful
watch dogs, were assembling, making ready
to take up the trail, heedless of the perils that
most certainly lurked beside the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>The pair had just alighted from the car
when of a sudden a startling figure appeared
before them. Rounding the end of the car it
started toward them&mdash;a skeleton with bones
bleached white, a white robe flowing behind
it! This was the form that in the dim light of
the car-yard approached them.</p>
<p>With an involuntary exclamation Johnny
started back. Not Tom Howe. With the
spring of a panther he was upon the creature.
Next instant he was sprawling upon the
ground. He had received such a blow on the
head as put him out for the count of ten. Then,
with a laugh as hollow as a voice from a graveyard
at midnight, the skeleton set off at a
long striding gallop. He was lost from sight
before Johnny could recover from his surprise
or Tom Howe could scramble to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a galloping ghost!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed,
as he bent over his companion. &ldquo;Are you
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not much.&rdquo; Howe was coming round.
&ldquo;Hardly at all. But, man! Oh, man! What
hard knuckles that ghost has!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? A ghost?&rdquo; Once more a new
voice broke in upon them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Johnny looked up, then scowled. He had
recognized the voice of a reporter from the
city&rsquo;s pink journal. He hated the paper and
disliked this reporter. But when one speaks of
a ghost he needs must explain.</p>
<p>Explain he did, and that with the least possible
number of words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ghost! A galloping ghost on the scene of
a kidnaping that is sure to cause a nation-wide
search! What a scoop!&rdquo; The reporter was
away even before Johnny had completed his
meager description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A galloping ghost.&rdquo; Johnny pronounced
the words slowly as Howe, now quite recovered,
stood up beside him, then scowled.
&ldquo;What do you make of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; Howe answered bluntly.
&ldquo;But, after all, the real question is, is this ghost
for us or against us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do ghosts always take sides?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, inevitably!&rdquo; Howe laughed a short
cackling laugh that went far toward relieving
the tension of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what Drew has
been doing. He&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Watch out! Duck!&rdquo; Seizing Johnny&rsquo;s arm
with a vice-like grip, he dragged him down.</p>
<p>Not an instant too soon. There came the
crack of a pistol, followed by the dull thwack
of a bullet against the side of the car just over
their heads. And after that a cold, dead silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER V</span>
<br />RED WINS TO LOSE</h2>
<p>Drew Lane, Tom Howe&rsquo;s team mate,
had not seen the Galloping Ghost. In
truth it was some distance from the sleeping
car to the river bank. After picking his way
across the tracks, flashing his light this way
and that in search of clues&mdash;some article
dropped in hasty flight, a broken match, a
cigaret thrown away&mdash;he came at last to a
narrow stretch of rock-strewn, cinder-embedded
ground.</p>
<p>Here his mood changed. Snapping off his
light, he thrust one hand deep in his coat
pocket and sauntered forward like some college
youth taking the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>This was Drew Lane&rsquo;s favorite pose. With
his faultless derby, his spotless suit of sea-green
and his natty tie, he carried it off well.
Many a tough egg had called him a &ldquo;fresh
college kid,&rdquo; only to find himself the next moment
lying on the sidewalk feeling of a lump
on his jaw caused only by Drew&rsquo;s capable fist.</p>
<p>That fist at this moment was curled around
a nasty looking thing of blue steel. At a second&rsquo;s
notice Drew could set that blue steel pal
of his spouting fire, right through his pocket.
And his aim, while indulging in this type of
shooting, was the despair of all evil doers.</p>
<p>Drew was approaching what appeared to be
a dangerous spot. In the half darkness before
him a great steam shovel mounted on a dredge
stood with crane outstretched like some fabled
bird ready to bend down and pluck his lifeless
body from the river. Plenty there were, too,
who would have witnessed the act with a grunt
of satisfaction.</p>
<p>As he approached the dredge a small craft,
moored ahead of the dredge and smelling
strongly of fish, gave forth a hollow bump-bump.</p>
<p>Fearlessly the young detective hopped
aboard this fishing schooner. For a moment
his light flashed here and there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Hopping ashore, he made his way to the
scow supporting the dredge. Having reached
it, he dropped on hands and knees, to creep
its entire length. From time to time, with the
aid of his flashlight, he examined several posts
and the outer surface of the scow. When at
last he stood once more upon his feet it was
with a grunt of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Went south,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Speed boat,
all right. Wonder how far? Go up the river
in the morning. Find out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken short off by the
bark of an automatic. One shot, that was all;
then silence.</p>
<p>With the spring of a panther Drew was off
the barge, across the narrow open space and
lost in the labyrinth of sleeping cars.</p>
<p>In an astonishingly short time he was close
to the scene of the mysterious kidnaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom! Tom Howe!&rdquo; he called softly. &ldquo;Are
you there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>There came no answer. Only from the river
came the hollow bump-bump of the fishing
schooner. &ldquo;Tom! Tom Howe!&rdquo; he called.
Still no answer.</p>
<p>Then, without warning, the car before him
began to move. For lack of a better thing to
do, he hopped aboard and went rattling away
into the city&rsquo;s great depot.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was during this same night, at a somewhat
later hour, that Red Rodgers and the
mysterious girl stood in the obscurity of the
cabin doorway. Breathing hard and peering
out into the night, they were poised as if for
flight.</p>
<p>The slight hold of the lock had been broken.
They were free to go. But which way? They
were on an island. How long was this island?
How large was the island? What was its nature?
Was it all tangled forest? Were there
trails, clearings, deserted cabins? To these
questions Red could form no answers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better have a try for their boat,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>In answer the girl pressed his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>Then together they stole out in the night.
The shadow of a giant spruce tree swallowed
them up.</p>
<p>After that, to an impersonal observer there
might have appeared a gliding bit of darkness
from time to time, followed by two black figures
leaping at one another by the foot of the
small dock.</p>
<p>The action of the figures increased in its
intensity, yet there was no sound. They
writhed and twisted. One went down upon
a knee, but was up again on the instant. They
went over in a heap to roll upon the ground.
They tumbled about until they reached the
dock and all but tumbled into the icy water.</p>
<p>Then, as suddenly as it began, the struggle
ceased.</p>
<p>For ten brief seconds one figure sat upon
his opponent. Then he beckoned. A third figure
appeared. Groping about the dock, this
figure at last seized upon some object that cast
little shadow. This it handed to the crouching
figure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Some seconds of suspense, and at last two
figures, one tall, one short, stood side by side
looking at the water and the dock.</p>
<p>As they stood there, some trick of the moonlight
and shadows made their two forms appear
to melt into one; and that form presented
a spectacle of abject despair. Thirty seconds
this pose was held. Then the shadow appeared
to explode and two figures melted into the
shadows to the right.</p>
<p>What had happened? Red Rodgers had
fought a battle and won, only to find that he
had in reality lost. While groping his way
toward the dock he had been detected and
pounced upon by the kidnapers&rsquo; guard.</p>
<p>From earliest childhood Red had been prepared.
A boy, reared among the tough fists
of a steel town school, must be. When, in his
teens, he had wrestled with red hot steel, this
instinct for absolute preparedness had been intensified.
Football had added to this training.
When one considers that he was as quick as
a panther, as strong as a lion and as cool-headed
as a prize fighter, one must know that
the flabby guard stood little chance. Instantly
Red&rsquo;s arm was about his neck in a clinch
that prevented the least outcry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>The outcome of the battle you already know;
but not quite. When the boy had conquered
his opponent, when he had bound and gagged
him, he went to look for the rowboat. Then
it was that his lips formed a single word:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the girl, who in the moonlight seemed
pitifully small, echoed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where was this boat? Had it drifted away?
Or had a second kidnaper rowed away to a
second island, lying a stone&rsquo;s throw away, for
help?</p>
<p>No answer could be found. One thing remained
to be done: to vanish into the night.
This the strange pair lost no time in doing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER VI</span>
<br />THE RED ROVER GETS THE BREAKS</h2>
<p>Drew Lane entered his room at three
o&rsquo;clock that morning. He and Tom
Howe occupied a room together in the Hotel
Starling. It was a very large place. Their
room was on the top floor.</p>
<p>Throwing his coat over a chair he sank into
a place by a table in the corner and allowing
his head to drop on his arm tried to collect his
thoughts. He had been following clues. A reporter
from the News had given him a &ldquo;hot
tip&rdquo; that grew cold almost at once. Casey
from the State Street Police Station had given
him another. It had led to nothing. After
that he had begun setting traps. Calling in
three trusted stool-pigeons, he had laid out
their tasks for them. Having consulted his
chief, he had begun laying plans for raiding
all known hang-outs for kidnaping gangs.
After that he had picked up a copy of the
city&rsquo;s pink sheet and had read in glaring headlines:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>GHOST NO LONGER WALKS. HE
GALLOPS.</p>
<p>He had read with some surprise the story
of the Galloping Ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rotten bit of sensation,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I
saw no ghost. Don&rsquo;t believe Howe did either.
But that shot? Who fired it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at Howe&rsquo;s bed in the corner.
Howe lay across it fully clad, sound asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to ask him,&rdquo; Drew muttered. &ldquo;Like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made a sudden move with his arm. Some
unusually hard object rested beneath it.</p>
<p>To his surprise he found on the table a
coarse brown envelope. On the face of it was
scrawled:</p>
<p><i>Sergeants Lane and Howe.</i></p>
<p>Turning it over, he dumped its contents
upon the table. A handful of shavings and one
very misshapen bullet, that was all; or so
he thought until he thrust in a hand and drew
forth a much crumpled bit of paper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>With a quick intake of breath, he flattened
the paper on the table.</p>
<p>Words were scrawled across the page. The
writing was very bad, as if a right-handed man
had undertaken to write with his left hand. In
time he made out the message.</p>
<p><i>Here are some important clues. Guard them
with care. When raids are made you will collect
firearms. Collect pocket knives as well. You
will hear from me later.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<i>The G.G.</i>&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Some crank,&rdquo; Drew muttered.</p>
<p>Then a thought struck him all of a heap.
How had the message gotten into their room?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howe brought it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. That is impossible. Had he read that
note he would have folded it neatly. That&rsquo;s
Howe every time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, here was fresh mystery. And what of
these clues? A bullet. That was always important.
But where had it been found? He examined
it closely. &ldquo;Wood sticking to it,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Been dug out.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>But what of the shavings? These too he examined.
After studying them carefully he was
convinced that some one, while waiting for a
second person perhaps, had occupied his time
whittling a bit of soft wood he had picked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is strewn with such piles made
by whittle-bugs,&rdquo; he told himself. He was
tempted to toss them into the waste paper
basket. Instead he slid them back into the
envelope.</p>
<p>After that he read the note through again.
&ldquo;Collect pocket knives.&rdquo; His voice took on a
note of disgust. &ldquo;What could be the good of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You will hear from me again.&rsquo; Well, here&rsquo;s
hoping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw the envelope to a back corner of
the table. But startling revelations would drag
it again to the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Collect pocket knives.&rdquo; Down deep in his
heart he knew that he would start this collection
to-morrow. He hated doing silly things.
But more than this he dreaded making fatal
blunders. &ldquo;A clue is a clue,&rdquo; he had said many
times, &ldquo;be it faint as a moon at midday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The battle Red Rodgers waged after leaving
the cabin at the edge of the narrow clearing
on that mysterious island was something quite
outside his past experience. True, he was not
unacquainted with struggle and peril. More
than once in the vast steel mill he had watched
hot sheet steel, caught by a defective roller,
curl itself into a serpent of fire, and had
dodged in the nick of time. On the gridiron,
with mad crowds screaming, with forms leaping
at him from right and left, he had over and
over battled his way to victory.</p>
<p>Now he faced neither man-made steel nor
man himself, but nature. Before him in the
dark lay a primeval wilderness; a small wilderness,
to be sure, but a real one for all that.
Here, on a rocky ridge scarcely one hundred
yards wide, for ages without number trees had
fought a battle to the death.</p>
<p>He had not gone a dozen paces when he
tripped and fell.</p>
<p>He felt ashamed that the girl must put out
a slender hand to guide him. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never
been in a forest,&rdquo; he half apologized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not even by day?&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s awed whisper
showed her astonishment. Her next remark
gave him a shock. &ldquo;Then you have never
truly lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladly would he have argued this point. But
this was no time for mere talk. It was a time
for action. They were on an island within a
bay. The bay reached far, to a larger island.
The larger island was far from the mainland.
If the kidnaper&rsquo;s statement was to be accepted,
there were no people on this larger island
save the kidnapers themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there are other cabins on this
island?&rdquo; He whispered this more to himself
than to the girl. She answered nevertheless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are none. We must get away as far
as we can. To the far end of the island. Then
we must think what is to be done next. Come,
we must go. Follow close behind me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>For a full half hour after that they waged
a silent battle with nature. Over fallen trees
that now tore at them with their tangled
branches and now sank treacherously beneath
their feet, around rocky ridges that offered
dangerous descents into tiny valleys so dark
that one might not see his hand before him,
they struggled on until with a sigh the girl
whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Too engrossed was Red in the unaccustomed
struggle to ask: &ldquo;What has made this trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was soon enough to know. In his pocket
he carried a small flashlight. Judging that they
were now far enough from the cabin to use
this, he pressed the button, then cast the light
down the trail.</p>
<p>Instantly he sprang back. The light was reflected
by a pair of large and burning eyes.</p>
<p>A confused impression of brown hair, of antlers
like spiked slabs of wood, and those burning
eyes held him rooted to the spot until the
girl&rsquo;s hand at his elbow guided him off the
trail and into the broad-spreading branches of
a fir tree. There, after a false step, he tumbled
into the fragrant boughs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>Without willing it, he drew the girl after
him. After that, for a full moment he remained
half reclining, feeling the wild beating
of the girl&rsquo;s heart and listening for he
scarcely knew what.</p>
<p>When he heard the sound he recognized
it; a slow, soft-padded plump-plump, and he
was relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing we have met on the trail,&rdquo; he
told himself, &ldquo;was not a horned demon, but
a giant moose.&rdquo; That he had been utterly at
a loss, and that the girl had directed their
course in a safe and sensible manner, he also
recognized.</p>
<p>After listening to the padded footsteps until
they faded out into the silence of the night, he
assisted the girl to her feet and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not a real person. You come from
a book. Your name is Alice, and we are having
adventures in Wonderland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am real enough.&rdquo; She laughed a low
laugh. &ldquo;My name is not Alice, but Berley
Todd. I am five feet tall and I weigh ninety
pounds. My favorite dish is blueberries with
ice cream on top.&rdquo; She laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that moose, I suppose, was quite an
old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. But a moose will not harm
you if you give him the right of way, which I
suppose is fair enough since this is his forest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But come. We must be near the end of the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red did not ask, &ldquo;How do you know this?&rdquo;
He merely followed on.</p>
<p>Scarcely a moment had passed when they
came out upon a pebbly shore. And there, as
he flashed his light about, he discovered a
nondescript raft of spruce logs. Dragged half
way up on the shore, it seemed for all its crudeness
to be a rather substantial affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said in a low tone, &ldquo;that
this entire affair has been arranged. You knew
the raft was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Becoming suspicious, he flashed his light
into a pair of very innocent-appearing blue
eyes. &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;you know
why I have been carried away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; The eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I live, no.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll have to ask some one else. It&rsquo;s
plain enough why they took me. Want my
dad&rsquo;s money. Expect my help in getting it.
They&rsquo;ll have no help from me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mister Man-who-don&rsquo;t-know-why-he&rsquo;s-here,
let&rsquo;s thank kind Providence for
this raft which some summer fisherman left
here, and shove off. Looks like we might go
across with nothing more than wet feet. What
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think is on the other
shore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cabins. Cabins and cottages, fireplaces,
blankets, easy chairs, and things to eat; not so
near, but not so far away, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red stared at her in silence. Did this girl
speak from knowledge of the island, or was
she romancing, bolstering up courage with
dreams that might prove false?</p>
<p>He dared not ask. Putting his stout shoulders
to work at shoving off the raft, he had it
afloat at once. Then, after selecting a stout
spruce pole and assisting the girl to a place
beside him, he shoved away toward that other
shore that, looming dark and distant, seemed
to beckon and to whisper of &ldquo;cabins and fireplaces,
blankets, easy chairs, and things to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;thus far we get the
breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER VII</span>
<br />A JOURNEY IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>While Drew Lane sat meditating on
the various aspects of the kidnaping,
Tom Howe groaned and sat up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; he drawled, rubbing his head, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
been felled by a ghost, a galloping ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you believe that
stuff!&rdquo; Drew held up the pink sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; said Howe with a wry grin,
&ldquo;that I have a large lump on the top of my
head and that it&rsquo;s sore. I believe it was put
there by a thing that looked like a ghost.
That&rsquo;s all I have to say about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, what have you to say about
this?&rdquo; Drew held up the envelope containing
the shavings and bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew showed him the contents and read the
note.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Curious sort of writing,&rdquo; he ended. &ldquo;And
look how he signed it: &lsquo;The G.G.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; drawled Howe, &ldquo;could stand for
&lsquo;The Galloping Ghost.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>must</i>!&rdquo; Drew struck the table with his
fist. &ldquo;But why all the secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Howe replied thoughtfully, &ldquo;will
probably come out later. The only question
that matters seems to be: Is this ghost with
us or against us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With us. Can&rsquo;t be any doubt about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;d better follow his suggestions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collect pocket knives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Interesting collection. What
sort of knives do crooks carry? Bet you can&rsquo;t
tell. Well, now we&rsquo;ll know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right. But say!&rdquo; Drew exclaimed.
&ldquo;What did you get from the car, the
one the Red Rover was snatched from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bed sheet.&rdquo; Howe held it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&mdash;?&rdquo; Drew stared at his partner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Some one had stepped on the bed, probably
with his shoe on. I thought I&rsquo;d try the ultra-violet
ray on it. Surprising what it brings out
sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably worth a try.&rdquo; Drew was not enthusiastic.
Howe had gone in for scientific
crime detection lately. Drew was still for going
out and getting his man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howe,&rdquo; he demanded after a moment of
silence, &ldquo;who fired that shot back there in the
train yards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answer that. A hand was all I saw, a
hand thrust out from behind a car. Fired
point-blank at me. And missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be the bullet,&rdquo; Drew mused,
weighing the battered bullet from the mystery
envelope in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be. Don&rsquo;t seem likely, though.
That bullet struck the side of a steel car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have glanced. Mighty fine evidence.
Find the gun that fired this bullet and you&rsquo;ve
got the man. Gun scratches the bullet as no
other gun would. Microscope brings out that,
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure does. You find the man and his gun.
I&rsquo;ll do the rest.&rdquo; Howe gave vent to a low
chuckle. &ldquo;Nothing would please me more!
Not a nice thing, this being shot at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kidnapers are not nice people.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s
tone changed. &ldquo;Fact is, they&rsquo;re about the worst
people in all the world. Should be shot at sunrise,
every man of &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; he philosophized, &ldquo;stealing
diamonds. They&rsquo;re only a lot of stones after
all. And money. &lsquo;Who steals my purse steals
trash. &rsquo;Twas mine. &rsquo;Tis his, and has been a
curse to thousands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think!&rdquo; He sprang to his feet. &ldquo;Think
of the cowards that steal a human life, a helpless
woman, an innocent child, and then send
back word, &lsquo;Money, much money, or we will
take the life of this one we have snatched.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s like going into battle
holding a woman before you to stop the bullets!
Howe, old boy, we&rsquo;ve got a task laid out
for us, a man-sized task, and we&rsquo;re going to do
it! You see if we don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Howe smiled in a quiet way. A quiet chap,
was this slender detective; quiet, but feared in
the underworld as many a big blustering cop
was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; he said after a long silence, &ldquo;why
did they snatch the Red Rover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge, perhaps. The university has been
fighting kidnapers. Think what a bold stroke
it would be to carry off their super-star just a
few days before the final great game of the
season!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds pretty,&rdquo; said Howe thoughtfully.
&ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t click. Crooks waste little time
on revenge. Dough is what they are after.
Money. Money. Money. That is their long
cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s there money in snatching a
football star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows? Perhaps they&rsquo;re being paid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paid? By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northern wants to win. Isn&rsquo;t Northern
Old Midway&rsquo;s ancient rival? Doesn&rsquo;t the
championship hang in the balance? What&rsquo;s a
few thousand dollars when such a prize is at
stake?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But universities are not like that!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not the schools. Of course not. But alumni.
Who can say what some rich and over-enthusiastic
alumnus would risk to see that
game won?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much sense to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. But what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may be hoping that Old Midway will
dig deep to get their star back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s the racket we&rsquo;ll know soon enough.
There&rsquo;ll be letters, phone calls, demanding
ransom. What say we turn in? To-morrow is
just around the corner. And to-morrow we
must be out and after &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the first move?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trace that speed boat down the river, the
one that carried him away. It went south,
that&rsquo;s clear enough. I saw where they tied up
to an old scow. Scraped her side when they
left; rubbed off a lot of mud. The shape of
the spot showed plain enough which way they
were going. Somehow we&rsquo;ve got to find their
hide-out and get the Red Rover back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Had the speaker been privileged to see the
Red Rover at that moment ankle deep in icy
water, making his way as best he could with
pole and improvised paddle on a raft that,
turning round and round, seemed to go nowhere,
he would surely have understood that a
long trail lay before him. Not being granted
such a vision, he crawled into his bed and went
sound asleep.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>There was no sleep for Red Rodgers and
his mysterious little friend on the raft.</p>
<p>There had been clumsy, flat-bottomed boats
in the rust-blackened slips where monster ore
boats lay near Red&rsquo;s boyhood home, but no
rafts.</p>
<p>Just how does one propel a raft? By a long
pole where water is shallow. But one does not
endeavor to drive the raft in the direction he
wishes to go. He is more likely to achieve his
end if he shoves in the opposite direction. For
a raft, like an ox, a mule or a reindeer, is likely
to go its own cranky way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>This Red learned soon enough. Scarcely had
he begun poling than the raft started spinning
like a top. It was only under the girl&rsquo;s expert
direction that he at last started for the shore
that loomed dark and ragged in the distance.</p>
<p>They had not gone a dozen yards when the
bottom sank beneath the end of the pole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we must paddle.&rdquo; Heedless of the icy
water, the girl dropped upon one knee, seized
a narrow slab of wood and began a vigorous
dip-dip that in time, it seemed, must take them
somewhere.</p>
<p>Following her example, Red, on the opposite
side, did his bit.</p>
<p>Under this treatment the raft behaved admirably.
Keeping in view only the shore they
had left, they paddled for a good half hour
when, with a shock that all but sent them
splashing into the water, they struck a hard
object that gave out a hollow sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shore?&rdquo; There was relief in Red&rsquo;s tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No shore.&rdquo; The girl stood up. Her head
struck something and she bounced down
again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thunder and guns! What now?&rdquo; Red
turned about to stare with all his eyes. The
thing they had bumped into was a hydroplane,
the very one that had carried them to this deserted
spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The girl seized his arm. &ldquo;Can&mdash;can
you fly it?&rdquo; Hope and fear were mingled in
her tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Red stammered. &ldquo;To-night
I took my first airplane journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t say I wanted to come,&rdquo; he
added as a witty afterthought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed suddenly. &ldquo;You just
hang on here a bit. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be right back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were beneath one of the machine&rsquo;s
great wings. Reaching up, he swung himself
to the upper surface, and disappeared into the
dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dangerous business,&rdquo; he muttered to himself.
&ldquo;May have heard that bump, those fellows.
May see my light. Might come upon us
here any minute, but it&rsquo;s a chance you can&rsquo;t
pass up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>By dropping here, climbing there, then moving
over to the right, he reached one of the
twin motors. There, after flashing his light
for a moment, he put out a hand, fumbled
about, then pocketed a small object. These
actions were repeated when he reached the
second motor.</p>
<p>After that, with a sigh of relief, he dropped
back upon the raft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fix &rsquo;em!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Fix &rsquo;em plenty,
the dirty dogs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now come on. Let&rsquo;s get out of here quick!
Wish we could take one of those pontoons for
a boat; but that&rsquo;s impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cloud had gone over the moon. He felt
the girl&rsquo;s cold hand as she steadied him down
to a safe place of balance on the raft, and he
chided himself for being so long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cabins,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Cabins with fireplaces,
easy chairs, blankets, and things to
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this seemed very, very far away. And
yet with youth &ldquo;hope springs eternal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they worked their imperfect
oars. In a surprisingly short time they once
more bumped. With a low cry of hope, the girl
sprang ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There should be a trail,&rdquo; she called back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose trail?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose and men. Here! Here it is! We go
this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led on over a trail so carpeted with moss
that their footsteps made no sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This girl knows a lot about this island,&rdquo;
Red said to himself. &ldquo;How come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again he was tempted to believe that
she was in league with the kidnapers. &ldquo;That
doesn&rsquo;t make sense either. Mixed up mess.
Just have to tramp on and see how it all comes
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tramped on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER VIII</span>
<br />&ldquo;THE RAT&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The path followed by Red Rodgers and
the girl was little more than a wild animal
trail along the edge of a wilderness.</p>
<p>Evening dew had placed its cold wet hand
over all. Here they passed through clumps of
alder that showered icy drops upon them, here
waded waist deep in ferns that were like a
tossing sea, and here again they crowded their
way through clusters of young spruce huddled
close together like children afraid of the
night.</p>
<p>They had not gone a quarter of a mile when
they were soaked to the skin. Still, without a
word, the girl, gripping Red&rsquo;s small flashlight,
trudged pluckily forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could lose ourselves in this wilderness,&rdquo;
Red commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we follow the shore.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>That, Red told himself, was true enough.
But where would the shore lead them? To
cabins, fireplaces, chairs, things to eat? He
fancied that this girl had been romancing,
dreaming to keep up her courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer old world,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Here
I was, twenty-four hours ago, watched over
like a child. Must eat this, must not eat that.
Must sleep so long. Was there an ache, a slight
sprain? Send for the rub-doctor. Did I cough
once? Send in the M.D. And now this. In the
wilderness. Drenched to the skin. No doctor.
No osteopath. No one to tell me what to eat.
Free!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, such freedom! I may be caught
any time and brought back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to what?&rdquo; He shuddered. Well,
they&rsquo;d have to find him. That would be difficult.
And then they&rsquo;d have a fight on their
hands. He was strong, as strong as a bull
moose. They&rsquo;d not get that girl again without
a fight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort of girl,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Queer
place this. You meet a moose on the trail, you
politely step aside and he walks calmly past.
You&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d snort and vanish or roar a
challenge and charge. Never heard of such
things. That girl&rsquo;s got the place bewitched.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; The girl had come to a halt. One
hand was on his arm. With the other she parted
the bushes. &ldquo;Do you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That dark spot over yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s another island. There&rsquo;s a cabin on it,
and a boat house. Boats too. And in the cabin
there is a fireplace and easy chairs, blankets,
and&mdash;and things to eat.&rdquo; She swayed a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s not far.&rdquo; She steadied herself on
his arm. &ldquo;I&mdash;I think I could swim it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not!&rdquo; Red began stripping off
his coat. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swim it and bring back a boat.
Here, hold this. I&rsquo;ll take off my shoes, too.
The rest doesn&rsquo;t matter. I&rsquo;ll be soaked anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another moment and he was in the water
swimming strongly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Red was a fine swimmer. In the slips where
rusty ore boats lay at anchor in his home city
he had learned to swim before he could talk
well.</p>
<p>The distance to the island he found surprisingly
short. Before he knew it he was
touching rocky shoals that led up to a low
bank lined with spruce and birches.</p>
<p>As he stood there shaking the water from
him like a spaniel, he saw a dark bulk to his
right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boat house.&rdquo; He flashed the electric torch,
which he had carried across in his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the cabin.&rdquo; Once again his
light darted about. There appeared to be a
number of small cabins grouped around a
larger central one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mysterious sort of place!&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Wonder who built it. Who lives there? And
when?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A cold blast of wind came sweeping up the
narrow channel. It chilled him to the bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to storm. I must get back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A fireplace and easy chairs, blankets,
things to eat,&rdquo; he whispered as he stumbled
along over the slippery stones.</p>
<p>He thought of the girl standing back there
alone, drenched with dew, chilled by the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must get back. At once!&rdquo; He quickened
his steps.</p>
<p>On reaching the shore side door of the boat
house, he found it locked. With a mutter of
disgust, he hurried along a narrow plank walk
to the other end. There he plunged waist deep
into water, to make his way beneath the great
outer door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room for a rowboat beneath this door,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;Let &rsquo;em keep their launch. No
gas anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A swing of the light showed him a sizeable
launch suspended above the water. But that
which gladdened his heart was a staunch little
rowboat tipped on its side and resting on a
narrow ledge at the right of the hole of black
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we ask,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Oars? Ah, yes!
There they are. Now to tip her over.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>This he accomplished without a sound. The
oars dropped silently into their places. He
was in the act of pushing the boat into the
black hole of water when a blood-curdling
scream, coming from the shore side, froze every
drop of blood in his veins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;they got her!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;And
after all this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a space of many seconds his heart stood
still. Then it raced like an engine without a
governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got her. Will they keep her? We&rsquo;ll
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red&rsquo;s fighting blood was up. And could Red
fight? Ask the boys of the gridiron. Count
them as they go down before him; one, two,
three. Yes, Red could fight. He could fight
steel and had; could fight hard opponents on
the gridiron. And as for these kidnapers&mdash;dirty
dogs, buzzards, beasts in human form&mdash;he&rsquo;d
show &rsquo;em!</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was at this same hour that Tom Howe
received a visitor, and a very curious specimen
of humanity he was. You will need to become
well acquainted with him, as he plays an important
role in our story. That is one of the
jolly features of this life we live; on life&rsquo;s stage
the humblest individual can, and often does,
play an important role.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>This visitor, who knocked timidly on the
young detective&rsquo;s door just as he was dressing,
was known all up and down the river front as
&ldquo;The Rat.&rdquo; I say he was known; the truth is
that he was known to but a few. As a sort of
compensation, those few knew him very well.
Tom Howe knew him well.</p>
<p>He had a curious occupation, did the Rat.
He found out things that people wished to
know. And his particular province was the
river. He never left it save to deliver a message.
At night, in a narrow boat, little more
than a canoe and painted dark gray inside and
out, he might have been seen cruising up and
down the river. Or rather, he was not likely
to be seen; his craft and his dirty, dull-colored
garb blended in with breakwaters, with piles
and all manner of dark and shadowy places.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>Thus the Rat lurked about the river at night,
gathering scraps of information which might
be sold for a price to certain gentlemen who
wished to know such things.</p>
<p>Was the Rat particular regarding the character
of his customers? Probably not. Some
were favored before others, for all that. Tom
Howe and Johnny Thompson might have his
services at their very best, and that with no
thought of charge. Every creature, even a rat,
has a sense of gratitude. Johnny Thompson,
who, as you will recall, was a great friend of
Drew Lane and Tom Howe, had once found
the Rat dying of fever. He and Howe had
saved him from the hospital, which he dreaded
with the fear of death, by hiring a nurse to
care for him in his river front hovel.</p>
<p>Now, after an all-night search at Howe&rsquo;s
request, he had something of importance to report.</p>
<p>The Rat had a way of seeming in a great
rush. He puffed as he talked and from time to
time his sharp nose shot forward, his small
black eyes popped just as a rat&rsquo;s will.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat speed boat, it&mdash;it&mdash;dat boat,&rdquo; he puffed
now, &ldquo;you know de Wop what camps under de
Twelfth Street bridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; Howe replied eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;De Wop saw it. Fine speed boat. Very
fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What color?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Col-color? Can&rsquo;t see. Too dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know de Chink got laundry by de
river just past de scrap yard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He heard de speed boat.&rdquo; The Rat took a
turn around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it went that far?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat far!&rdquo; The Rat bulged his eyes. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s
not a start. You know de t&rsquo;ree bums dat hang
round de old warehouse way down de river,
de big warehouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not strange,&rdquo; Drew Lane put in. &ldquo;A
speed boat comes near being a curiosity that
far down the river. They&rsquo;d be sure to notice
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; The Rat took another turn
around the room. &ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s what I say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know de gypsies campin&rsquo; by de river?
Cottonwood trees grow on dat place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dey don&rsquo;t see it, don&rsquo;t hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Not dat. Squattin&rsquo; by de fire, playin&rsquo;
cards. Dey don&rsquo;t hear dat boat. Don&rsquo;t see
it, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Drew Lane, &ldquo;our search narrows.
The boat landed somewhere between the
old warehouse and the gypsy camp. Can&rsquo;t be
more than six blocks apart. Let&rsquo;s see, what&rsquo;s
out that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some homes,&rdquo; said Howe. &ldquo;Some shacks&mdash;abandoned,
tumble-down places&mdash;a roadhouse
or two. The airport is not far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, the airport.&rdquo; Drew said these
words with little animation. At that moment
the airport did not enter deeply into his conscious
thoughts. In time it was to take on a
deep significance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Rat. Good work! Here&rsquo;s your
breakfast.&rdquo; Howe pressed a bill into the Rat&rsquo;s
paw-like hand.</p>
<p>At this instant there came a loud banging
at the door.</p>
<p>With a startled glance the Rat sprang for a
second door at the opposite end of the room.
This door opened into Tom Howe&rsquo;s tiny laboratory
for the scientific study of crime. The
window of this room looked out on the fire
escape.</p>
<p>Neither Drew Lane nor Tom Howe paid
the slightest attention to the Rat&rsquo;s going. He
was by nature what his name implied; a loud
banging at any door found him seeking a hole
through which he might escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that at this hour of the morning?&rdquo;
Drew grumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Search me.&rdquo; Tom Howe slipped a blue-barreled
automatic into his coat pocket,
gripped it firmly in his left hand, then threw
the door wide, to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! So it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER IX</span>
<br />RED GOES INTO ACTION</h2>
<p>All his life Red Rodgers had been trained
for action. In the steel mills there come
times when men are divided into two classes,
the quick and the dead. Red was not dead.
The instant that piercing cry, coming from the
opposite shore, reached his ears, he was alert,
ready to act. His hand, already on the side of
the rowboat, relaxed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oars creak,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Across the dark pool rested a canoe. He was
there in a flash, canoe in the water, paddle in
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a weapon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was, of course, unarmed. As his eyes
roved about in that narrow space, they fell
upon a pike pole. With a stout eight-foot handle
and a steel point it was a weapon of a
sort, spear or club, whichever he might choose.
Reaching for this, he placed it without a sound
in the canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>Then he slid out into the silent night. The
wind, he found, was growing stronger. It
chilled him through. &ldquo;Be warm enough soon.&rdquo;
He set his teeth grimly.</p>
<p>Waves sweeping in from somewhere down
the channel threatened to overturn his fragile
craft. He handled it with skill. Great black
banks of cloud came rolling across the sky.
The darkness was intense; yet he knew his
direction. He pressed forward&mdash;to what? He
could not say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a fight, it will be a good one.&rdquo; His
hands grasped the paddle with a grip of steel.
&ldquo;God is on the side of the fellow who fights for
the right. There&rsquo;s nothing right about men
who carry away innocent girls and then demand
a reward for their return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was sending the canoe forward with
strong, sweeping strokes. Now he judged himself
to be halfway across, now two-thirds. His
pulse quickened. Had he heard a sound? Some
one moving?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>A question came suddenly into his mind.
He ceased paddling. How should he come upon
them? In the canoe? He&rsquo;d be knocked into
the water, first pop. Better to land below, then
creep upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six inches of moss everywhere. I&rsquo;ll make
no sound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He changed his course. The canoe shot away.</p>
<p>He beached his canoe among alder bushes,
then, pike pole in hand, crept forward. Holding
his breath he parted bushes here, crossed
a log there, climbed over a moss-covered boulder,
then paused to listen. No sound save the
rush of water against rocky shores. Boo!
How cold it was! How the clouds raced! Going
to snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should be about there,&rdquo; he told himself,
and his pulse pounded.</p>
<p>Ten more steps on the yielding moss, and
again he paused. &ldquo;Just one or two more trees.&rdquo;
A black old spruce stood before him. &ldquo;Just one
or two, and then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was that? A voice? Some one
humming low? Yes, there it was!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bury me not on the lone prairee, where
the coyotes howl ee-e&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The song trailed off into nothing.</p>
<p>He stood there too astounded to move. The
voice was that of a girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be that girl, Berley Todd. But she&mdash;she
screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having regained his power of motion, he
rounded the spruce tree&rsquo;s spreading branches.</p>
<p>And then the moon rolled out from behind
a cloud.</p>
<p>What he saw held him spellbound. There
stood the girl, her graceful figure swathed in
dew-drenched clothing, her face scanning the
black waters as she still sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bury me not on the lone prairee&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gasp of astonishment from his lips startled
her. She turned with the suddenness of a
frightened deer. Then, as she saw his figure
outlined against the spruce tree, she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you! I&rsquo;m glad. I&rsquo;m drenched with the
dews of Heaven. I&rsquo;m frozen to a statue. Please,
let&rsquo;s hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>Red said never a word. In response to her
request he hurried. Five minutes had not
passed when their canoe bumped on the other
shore. They skirted the boat house, rounded a
long low cabin and at last reached a door.</p>
<p>The door, which was fastened, yielded to
Red&rsquo;s sturdy shoulder. Then they were inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o!&rdquo; the girl breathed. &ldquo;How warm it
seems! As if there were a fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red flashed his torch about the room. A
large fireplace, built of channel rocks, was just
before him. As if they had been expected, the
fire was laid, and a box of safety matches lay
on the rustic mantel.</p>
<p>A match flared, a slow yellow flame mounted
higher and higher and filled the room with
light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the girl cried suddenly. &ldquo;You are the
Red Rover? I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call me.&rdquo; Red did not
smile. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry! Why are you sorry?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry that you know. I&rsquo;d rather be plain
Red Rodgers who works in a steel mill and has
ambitions of his own to become a foreman or
a steel tester, or something like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him in a puzzled way. Then
her mood changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I believe you&rsquo;re wet. See!
You are making puddles on the floor. And I&mdash;I&rsquo;m
sort of dampish myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a look about,&rdquo; said Red.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later they returned to the
fire. The girl had garbed herself in patched
knickers a size too large, and a flaming red
jacket. Red wore a mechanic&rsquo;s coveralls.</p>
<p>And now he said: &ldquo;Perhaps you will tell
me why you screamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>But what of Drew Lane and Tom Howe?
And who was the one who stood banging on
their door at dawn?</p>
<p>You will be surprised when I tell you it was
none other than our old friend, Johnny Thompson.
Johnny was not in the habit of banging
on doors at dawn. At this moment, however,
his business was urgent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Just saw the Chief,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;He sent
me over hot-foot with a message for you. He
says you are to get those kidnapers without
delay and return the Red Rover to his squad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That right?&rdquo; Drew Lane arched his brows.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t tell you where we&rsquo;d be likely to find
these kidnapers, did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, and he didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny replied
shortly. Being young and only an amateur
detective, he held the Chief of Police in great
respect. For that matter, so did Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief says,&rdquo; Johnny went on after
swallowing hard, &ldquo;that &lsquo;the public is already
aroused. Why couldn&rsquo;t they have snatched a
senator or a governor instead of the greatest
football star of the age?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t much time for saying anything.&rdquo;
Johnny&rsquo;s excitement grew. &ldquo;Telephone
jangling all the time. Newspaper men,
university professors, rich graduates, and all
the little fellows who&rsquo;ve bought tickets for
Soldiers&rsquo; Field to see the Red Rover rove&mdash;all
calling at once and demanding that something
be done!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief says you are to raid these
places.&rdquo; He passed a slip of paper to Drew.
&ldquo;Suspected of kidnaping&mdash;the gangs that hang
out in these places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not without good reason,&rdquo; Drew grumbled.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Drew snatched the receiver.
&ldquo;Sergeant Lane speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened a moment, then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Chief. Just got the message. We&rsquo;ll get
those raids off at once.... Yes, some evidence&mdash;a
bed sheet....</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no marks. Bullet, and some shavings....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seize all guns, oh, sure! How about jack-knives?...</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not customary? Not against the rules, is
it?... A pocketknife is a weapon?...
Thought so. All right, I&rsquo;ll collect &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought he heard the Chief grumble
something about &ldquo;fool college kids collecting
pocket knives.&rdquo; Then Drew hung up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Drew drawled, &ldquo;time for a cup of
coffee and a plate of hots; then we&rsquo;ve got to
get out and give the public a great thrill by
bringing those kidnapers right in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be as easy as that, will it?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by a whole lot! The Red Rover must
be in his place on the gridiron of Soldiers&rsquo;
Field when the big game starts or the Police
Department is forever disgraced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worse than that,&rdquo; Johnny put in solemnly.
&ldquo;The Chief says it means his job and
yours if we fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We? Are you with us?&rdquo; Drew looked at
the boy detective hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the bitter end!&rdquo; Johny grinned. &ldquo;Never
had less of other things to do, and never wanted
to do anything quite so much as to help
find the Red Rover.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Think what it means!&rdquo; he enthused. &ldquo;Think
what sort of fellow the Red Rover is. None
of your rich man&rsquo;s pampered sons! A steel
mill worker, that&rsquo;s what he was. But he&rsquo;s a
student as well as a star. Been leading his
class in chemistry and math. Been working his
way, too. They say Marmon, the big meat
packer, offered to pay his way. He&rsquo;s a graduate
of Old Midway. But Red turned him down;
said it wasn&rsquo;t his idea of good sportsmanship,
nor the idea of the Grand Old Man&rsquo;s. Said he
was going on his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has. Three years. Steel mill worker
in summer, hotel clerk in winter. Who
wouldn&rsquo;t hunt for a chap like that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never had the swell-head either. Always
pushing the other fellows ahead of himself
when he could. They say he has practically
refused to take a play through on more than
one occasion when he considered the game
won. Insisted on the other chaps having a
chance at a touchdown. Went in for interference
instead and did double duty. Who
wouldn&rsquo;t want to go out and help get some
dirty crook who&rsquo;s snatched a chap like that?
What did they want him for? Revenge, or to
get a wad of filthy greenbacks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; Quiet Tom Howe sprang to his
feet and clapped his hands. &ldquo;Bravo! That&rsquo;s
a grand oration! I could go to work now
without my coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, by George, I will! Come on in here,
Johnny. I want you to help me try a thing
out.&rdquo; Tucking under his arm the bed sheet
he had taken from the Red Rover&rsquo;s car berth,
he disappeared inside his cubby-hole of a laboratory.
Johnny followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring up a can of coffee and some
doughnuts,&rdquo; Drew called.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O. K.&rdquo; was the muffled answer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER X</span>
<br />THE INVISIBLE FOOTPRINT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I scream?&rdquo; The girl in the patched
knickers sitting before the roaring fire
stared at Red Rodgers. &ldquo;Why should I
scream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Red was puzzled. &ldquo;I only
know I heard you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did not scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Red&rsquo;s turn to start. He had heard a
scream. No man, even in mortal agony, could
scream in that manner. What did it mean?
Who&mdash;?</p>
<p>His thoughts were broken off by a sudden
burst of laughter. It was the mystery girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that,&rdquo; she stammered, with an effort
at self control. &ldquo;It was not I who screamed,
but a loon, a silly old loon! Have you never
heard a loon scream in the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are to be forgiven. When a loon
goes about the business of screaming in earnest,
he can put a drowning woman to shame.
We who have heard them often become so
accustomed to them that we scarcely hear
them at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red stared first at the girl, then at the fire.
He was wondering in a vague sort of way
just how much he had missed by living all his
life within the confines of a city. He was to
wonder this many times before this business
of being kidnaped and carried to a deserted
island was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what that old loon is doing here?&rdquo;
the girl mused. &ldquo;All his pals must have gone
south by now. The gulls stay all winter. Some
kinds of ducks, too, and the jays and the
chickadees. It can&rsquo;t be very lonely here even
in winter. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be thrilling if we had
to stay here on and on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red stared harder at the fire as he tried in
vain to think what that would be like.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to know a lot about this island,&rdquo;
he blurted out quite suddenly. &ldquo;How does it
happen that kidnapers bring you to a place
where you have been before? Seems a trifle
mixed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered about that.&rdquo; Her big blue
eyes were round and frank. &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ve got
it figured out. Do you believe in God?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, I&mdash;I do. I&rsquo;ve prayed about football
sometimes; asked the One who gave me
my body to help me keep it clean and fit;
asked Him, too, to give me a clear brain and
a sharp eye for every play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she breathed, dropping a hand gently
on his arm, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad! Because I&mdash;I believe
in God. I hope He outwits evil men. And I&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
sort of felt that He saw that those men
were going to carry us off, you and me, so He
sort of winked, don&rsquo;t you know, like the man
in the moon seems to do, and He said: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
have those kidnapers take that boy and girl
to the island where the girl has spent her summers
as long as she can remember.&rsquo; And so,
don&rsquo;t you see? Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Red with conviction, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
great!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>Reaching for a large spruce log, he threw
it on the fire. When the shower of sparks had
subsided, he turned to her eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What place is this? Tell me about it, all
you can. We&mdash;we may be parted at any moment.
And I&mdash;I need to know a lot. In the end
they may get us, at least one of us, and the
other must be able to make his way out, in
the end, to see that justice is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the thought of the kidnapers he strode
to the door and opened it a crack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough for the present.&rdquo; His tension
relaxed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s snowing, snowing hard. They&rsquo;ll
never find us here in a snowstorm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she replied quietly. Her
eyes closed. They remained closed so long that
Red thought her asleep. But again they
opened. &ldquo;You are right, they will not find us
in the snow. You should know about this
place. I will tell you all I can. And then&mdash;then
we must rest, for long, hard hours are before
us. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to escape
from this place in November. But we
must try.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What place is this?&rdquo; the boy asked once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? You don&rsquo;t know our island?&rdquo; The
girl&rsquo;s eyes opened wide. &ldquo;This,&rdquo; her tone became
impressive, &ldquo;this is Isle Royale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She expects me to be greatly surprised,&rdquo;
Red said to himself. Out of respect for her
desire he did his best to show great astonishment.
The truth was that the part of social
science that deals with the world we live in
had interested him very little. He was all for
chemistry, physics, mathematics. He had no
more notion where Isle Royale was than the
Little Diomede Island, or King William&rsquo;s
Land. He had never heard of it. &ldquo;But she
evidently thinks it a great place,&rdquo; he told himself,
&ldquo;so great it shall be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me more about it,&rdquo; he demanded at
last. He was truly interested. If he was to
escape from this island, wild and uninhabited
as it appeared to be, he must at least know his
way about.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, Tom Howe, in his box-like
laboratory, had revealed to Johnny Thompson&rsquo;s
astonished eyes a bit of scientific crime detection
that for sheer cunning would have put
any ancient astrologer or alchemist to shame.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>Having spread the bed sheet taken from
Red Rodger&rsquo;s berth out on a small table, he
had switched on a 200-watt lamp and had proceeded
to examine it inch by inch as he slid
it across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a mark,&rdquo; Johnny commented, as the
examination was completed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; Howe drawled. &ldquo;A man
stepped on that sheet, a very heavy man. He
left a deep dent in the mattress and bedding.
It&rsquo;s hard to step on anything as clean as a
sheet without leaving some sort of mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; He drew the sheet endwise until
the very center rested on the smooth top of
the table. &ldquo;It would be about there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned off the powerful light. At once
the room was plunged in utter darkness.</p>
<p>Then, while Johnny waited as breathless as
a child at his first picture show, a curious violet
light pervaded the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Tom Howe whispered, pointing to
the center of the sheet.</p>
<p>Johnny did look, and there, to his vast astonishment,
he beheld quite clearly outlined the
footprint of a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sole of a heavy shoe!&rdquo; He was dumbfounded.
&ldquo;It was not there before! And see!
There are the marks of the nails; a heavy
workman&rsquo;s shoe. You could count those nails.
And a heel of some hard, prepared stuff with
the maker&rsquo;s name wrong way over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Howe added quietly, &ldquo;and a deep,
jagged cut across the sole. Slipped on some
sharp stone perhaps, when the sole was wet.
That marks the shoe. It&rsquo;s not like any other
shoe in the world. Find that shoe, find the man
who wears it, and we have made a discovery of
great importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand!&rdquo; Johnny was puzzled.
&ldquo;That mark was not there a moment
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor is it now.&rdquo; Tom Howe chuckled. The
violet light faded; the brilliant white light
flashed on. The footprint was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Magic!&rdquo; Johnny murmured. &ldquo;Some form
of magic. You can&rsquo;t convict a man with
magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not magic, but science!&rdquo; Howe&rsquo;s tone was
impressive. &ldquo;Crooks are learning to use science
as an aid in committing crimes. We must
use science to detect crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again the white light was gone; the
violet light returned and with it that mysterious
vanishing footprint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; Howe explained, &ldquo;when that fellow
entered the car to assist in carrying the
famous football star away, he had been walking
over a surface that contained some chemical
solution. If he had passed over damp coffee
grounds, or through a forest where rank
vegetable matter rotted, the effect would have
been as you see it now. His foot would have
left a mark invisible in white light, but quite
clearly outlined when subjected to the rays of
an ultra-violet lamp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This lamp,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;has detected the
secret writing of many a spy and jailbird. A
spy, wishing to forward a secret report, dips
his pen into a liquid made by soaking a few
quinine pills in water. This writing will not
show in white light until it has been treated.
He writes some commonplace letter over this
message and sends it forth. Our Secret service
men seize it, put it under the ultra-violet
lamp, and there it is; you can read every word.
The moment the lamp is snapped off the message
is gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A criminal may dip the corner of his jacket
in coffee, return to his cell, wring out the coffee
and write with the coffee a secret message
to some one who plots his deliverance. He,
too, may be caught by this ultra-violet lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;we have only to
find the man who wears this shoe. Very simple
in a city of three million.&rdquo; He smiled a
slow smile. &ldquo;All the same, it&rsquo;s a step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An invisible step,&rdquo; Johnny chuckled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER XI</span>
<br />HOTCAKES AT DAWN</h2>
<p>When a person is thrown with a stranger
in an empty land he is sure to learn
much of that other&rsquo;s ways. It was so with
Red Rodgers. He was destined to learn much
regarding the true nature of that mysterious
young person who called herself Berley Todd.
One fact he learned at once: that she was fond
of doing things in a dramatic manner. In her
own mind she was ever on the stage. Red had
asked her to tell of her beloved Isle Royale.
She was weary, had been awake all night. She
had been cold and wet. She was hungry. Surely
this was no time for telling of a place she
loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cabin,&rdquo; she recited, &ldquo;a fireplace, chairs,
blankets. We have all these. And now for the
last of all&mdash;things to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>Lighting a candle that stood on a ledge beside
the fireplace, she went into the kitchen of
the cabin. Soon she was calling to Red.</p>
<p>Together they carried in two large tin boxes
of what were quite evidently left-overs of the
party camping there that summer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crackers, dried beans, oatmeal, a little
rice.&rdquo; The girl named the packages as she
drew them forth. &ldquo;Tea, coffee. Hurrah! Some
coffee and prepared pancake flour. Hotcakes
at dawn!&rdquo; She tossed the package to the ceiling
and caught it as it came down. &ldquo;What
could be better than hot cakes and coffee at
dawn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glancing toward the window, Red discovered
that she was right; dawn was breaking.
But to his relief he saw that snow was still
falling fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those fellows get on our trail,&rdquo; he
thought with a shudder, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll keep on it
until they get us. They&rsquo;ve got to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red brewed the coffee. The girl mixed the
batter and fried the cakes.</p>
<p>The meal was eaten in silence. Red found
himself in no mood for talk; nor did the girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a communion,&rdquo; he told himself
with a gulp. He was sobered by the thought
of the future that lay just before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; said the girl, as the last cup
was drained, &ldquo;since this thing had to happen,
I am glad you are you.&rdquo; A curious smile overspread
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&mdash;er&mdash;thanks,&rdquo; Red stammered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
do my best to be myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the girl, leading him to a
place beside her on a rug near the hearth, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
show you about Isle Royale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dragging a quantity of ashes out on the
smooth hearth, she busied herself for some
time smoothing them out, drawing her finger
through them here and dropping a pinch of
them there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she sighed at last, &ldquo;ashes are land,
bare spaces are water. See this little pile here?
That&rsquo;s the island we are on. See, it&rsquo;s in a narrow
stretch of water. That&rsquo;s Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor.
It&rsquo;s about three miles long. See this one over
to the right? That&rsquo;s Rock Harbor. It&rsquo;s much
longer. Off to the left of Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor is
Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. It may not matter. And it
may. You can&rsquo;t tell where we&rsquo;ll end up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See that bit of a pile here? That&rsquo;s Passage
Island. There&rsquo;s a lighthouse out there with
people in it, a big light and a foghorn. Listen,
you can hear that horn now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red listened and to his waiting ears came
the distant hoot of a giant foghorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How simple it all is!&rdquo; He heaved a sigh of
relief. &ldquo;All we have to do is to get out to the
lighthouse before those fellows catch up to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all. But it&rsquo;s four
miles out there. This is the stormy season of
the year. We have only a rowboat. And remember
this&mdash;&rdquo; Her tone was as solemn as a
parson&rsquo;s at a funeral. &ldquo;Remember this: &lsquo;Superior
never gives up her dead!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is all that water you&rsquo;ve left there Lake Superior?&rdquo;
Red was truly impressed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a great deal more. Miles and
miles and miles. Isle Royale is nearer Canada
than the United States. It is not near enough
to any place to do us much good in November.
The lighthouse is our hope. But after the
snow it will blow. I am almost sure of that.
So, you see, that which was begun to-night
may not be finished at once, my friend the Red
Rover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now&mdash;&rdquo; Her eyes closed for a moment.
&ldquo;Now I would be glad to tell you of my island
home. I love it as I do no other home. If
danger did not threaten, I should dearly love
to remain here, even now when everyone is
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be fishermen staying at the
other end of the island. But that is forty-five
miles away. Forty-five miles of wilderness, do
you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Red Rodgers. A new
note had crept into his voice. He was beginning
to sense the brave part this girl was playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you must rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set about preparing a place for her on a
broad seat before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&mdash;&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll sleep with one eye open, here in a
chair. As long as snow continues to fall, we
are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the sky clears you will call me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While I sleep I will dream what we are to
do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success to your dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his back on her, Red busied himself
by drawing a crude map of the island modeled
after her relief map of ashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to be tough,&rdquo; he whispered with a
sigh. &ldquo;Tough for both of us. But somehow
we&rsquo;ll make it. We&rsquo;ve got to!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>After another look at the falling snow, he
curled up for three winks. He slept them
through, all unconscious of the commotion his
disappearance had stirred up. The hundreds of
columns printed about him in the papers all
over the land, the scores of detectives on the
trail of the kidnapers, the thousands of earnest
persons in all walks of life who had volunteered
to do all in their power to help bring him back&mdash;all
this he would have found, had he known
it, a matter for surprise and great bewilderment.
For the Red Rover was, above all, a
very humble and modest young man who loved
doing things for their own sake, and who
thought little of honor or great reward. That
the world at large had been so greatly stirred
by his disappearance he did not dream.</p>

<br />JOHNNY GETS A &ldquo;JIMMY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>That day Johnny Thompson, in quite an
accidental manner, came into possession
of certain facts that, while increasing his perplexity
at the time, were destined in the end to
go far toward solving a great mystery.</p>
<p>These facts were discovered as he went
about the business of purchasing a large bouquet
of chrysanthemums. No, Johnny had not
gone soft. He was not buying flowers for a
cigar clerk nor a telephone operator. Far from
that. There was a school for crippled children
just around the corner from his lodging. He
had come to know many of these children.
They loved flowers, as all right-minded children
do. He was sending them a bouquet.
Drew Lane and Tom Howe had gone about
the business of conducting a raid which, they
assured him, would be quite a tame affair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be expecting us,&rdquo; Drew grinned.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s never a big bank robbery pulled but
next day all the successful bank robbers are
called on by the police. It&rsquo;s the same with kidnapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you know they&rsquo;re bank robbers or kidnapers,
why don&rsquo;t you just send them down
to State&rsquo;s Prison and have it over with?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be neat and quite simple.&rdquo;
Drew smiled a broad smile. &ldquo;But the Constitution
grants every man a trial. You&rsquo;ve got
to prove what down deep in your heart you
know, so you have to go out and get the
facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll get some facts to-day, whether
they realize it or not,&rdquo; Tom Howe put in.
&ldquo;Drew&rsquo;s going to collect a gallon of pocket
knives. That&rsquo;s something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a lot,&rdquo; said Drew soberly.</p>
<p>So Johnny went to the shop at the foot of
the river bridge to buy flowers. He liked this
shop and its dark-skinned proprietor. The
man&rsquo;s name was Angelo Piccalo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Johnny!&rdquo; Piccalo welcomed him.
&ldquo;Some flowers to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Big yellow ones for the kids&mdash;crippled
kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crippled keeds.&rdquo; The flower merchant
grinned a broad grin. &ldquo;The biggest, the ver&rsquo;
best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flowers had been boxed and paid for,
the proprietor stood in his doorway bidding
Johnny good-bye, when a motor horn sounded
close at hand. Johnny started. He believed
it a car. To his surprise, though he looked up
and down the street, there was no car near
enough to have produced that sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speed boat.&rdquo; Angelo Piccalo grinned once
more. &ldquo;My boy. Name Angelo. See! Fine
boy, that one. No cripple heem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy who grinned up at them from the
river was surely no cripple. Some eighteen
years of age, he was the picture of perfect
youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to college next year,&rdquo; Piccalo confided.
&ldquo;Beeg gentleman some time, my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>Johnny will never know why he went down
the iron steps that led to the landing place
where the speed boat rested. There were
times when he almost regretted having done
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Angelo!&rdquo; he greeted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fine
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad.&rdquo; The younger Angelo&rsquo;s eyes
took him in at a glance. &ldquo;Not much speed.
Trade it in for a better one soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This flower business must pay very well,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;Bet he&rsquo;s got a car, a
fast one. Going to college, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Angelo had bent over to lift up the rear seat
of his boat. He was looking for something.
Plainly it was not there. Another object was
there that apparently annoyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been making my boat into a junk
wagon?&rdquo; He lifted out a bent iron bar and
was about to drop it in the river, when Johnny
stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Don&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You want it? All right. Here
it is.&rdquo; The boy tossed the bar to Johnny&rsquo;s
feet. It fell with a noisy jangle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>Thinking he had caught some sound from
above, Johnny looked up in time to surprise a
black look on the older Piccalo&rsquo;s usually smiling
face. One moment it was there. The next
it was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; Johnny thought. &ldquo;I must have
been mistaken.&rdquo; Yet he knew he had not been,
and found himself disturbed by that insistent
question, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a curious band you have for your
wrist watch,&rdquo; he said to the boy in the speed
boat. &ldquo;All green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Made of green stones,&rdquo; Angelo explained.
&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em on Isle Royale last summer. Fine
place, Isle Royale. Plenty big fish, wild moose.
Plenty pretty girls.&rdquo; He grinned broadly.
&ldquo;Found these stones on the beach up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny picked up the iron bar, climbed the
stairs and walked away. This bar might at
one time have been used by a merchant for
opening boxes and at another by some gentleman
of evil intentions in opening the window
of some other person&rsquo;s home. It is, I believe,
known in some circles as a &ldquo;jimmy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>Feeling a little foolish walking down the
street, he wondered why he had saved the bar
at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate to see the work of some man&rsquo;s hands
wasted,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Many a poor shopkeeper
on Maxwell Street would be glad to
own it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he wrapped it in his morning paper
and at last deposited it in back of a small desk
in Drew Lane&rsquo;s room. There it was to remain
until the time appointed. Then it was to offer
its bit of evidence regarding certain dark deeds
committed on a night in November of that
same year.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The snow that had fallen steadily since the
hour before dawn upon that tiny island in
Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor of Isle Royale ceased at ten
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>Standing before the window, Red Rodgers
watched a scene of matchless beauty unfold
before him. Dark, unruffled waters widened
moment by moment until at last trees, great
dark giant spruce and slender ghosts of birches,
began appearing.</p>
<p>When at last the snow fog had vanished
altogether he saw on the not-too-distant shore
spruce and balsam standing like rows of tall
tents of the Indians.</p>
<p>And even as he stood there some dark object
moved amongst the birch trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moose!&rdquo; he exclaimed under his breath.
Then again he wondered that the girl had
shown no fear at their encounter with an antlered
monarch back there on the trail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he told himself, as he watched the
great sleek creature on the opposite shore step
out to stand ankle deep in water, head high,
antlers gleaming, &ldquo;Life is strange! Here I
have lived all my life in a city. Never would
have known of this other world but for the
work of these outlaws who carried me away.
And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused. Well, what of now? He could
form no answer.</p>
<p>He turned about to look long and steadily
at the sleeping girl.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>Yes, life surely was strange. Nothing like
this had come to him before. As he looked at
the perfect repose of that face, something
welled up within him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She trusts me,&rdquo; he whispered. Until this
moment he had not known that such perfect
trust existed in the world. &ldquo;She trusts me.
She believes in me. Her father may be rich.
That does not matter. I will neither desert
nor betray her. We shall fight it out together,
to the bitter end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this serious-minded boy who until this
moment had known little of life as it is lived
save on the gridiron and in the steel mills, this
was a solemn covenant never to be broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he asked himself, &ldquo;what is to be
done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem he thought through with
care. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re likely to be looking for us,&rdquo;
he told himself. &ldquo;Yes, their search will be
rather a wild one, when they know.&rdquo; He put
a hand to his pocket. Then his face sobered.
Had he made a mistake?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If only we can make a clean get-away they
are sunk!&rdquo; he muttered, clenching his fists. &ldquo;I
am not sorry I took the chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again his thoughts returned to the
problem at hand. &ldquo;A step in the snow will
betray us,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Now the unmarked
snow says we are not here. Better to
wait for darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having come to this conclusion, he sank
deep in his chair and fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>He awoke some hours later to be greeted
by the faint aroma of tea brewing and biscuits
baking on the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s dark now,&rdquo; a voice whispered in his
ear. &ldquo;We must be moving soon. But first we
must eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red ate that meal in silence. He was thinking
hard. &ldquo;The game for to-day is over,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;We have won. No radio must
tell me that. They didn&rsquo;t need me to-day.
Probably the Grand Old Man would not have
put me in to-day at all; save me for Saturday&rsquo;s
game. He said I was getting slow on my feet.
Well, probably I was. Tired, that&rsquo;s what I
was. Football takes it out of a fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Saving me.&rdquo; He grinned in spite of himself.
&ldquo;I was saved all right; put away for the
winter, like as not; pickled like a cucumber in
a jar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without really thinking what he was doing,
he rose and began pacing the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worried?&rdquo; The girl smiled up at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep, quite a little. About Saturday&rsquo;s
game.&rdquo; He dropped into a chair. &ldquo;You see,
our coach, the Grand Old Man, we call him,
is getting along in years. This may be his last
season. Who knows? It&rsquo;s almost sure to be
his last winning team. Five of our best men
graduate this year. Breaks up the line. And,
well, you know, the coach is such a square
shooter, he&rsquo;s so human and kind, seems to love
his boys so, that you just naturally want to do
things for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said the girl quietly. &ldquo;And
I know the success of the team depends on
you, Red Rover. Read all about it in the papers.
You&rsquo;re going to play on Saturday. And
I&rsquo;ll be cheering on the side lines.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Red flashed her a grateful smile. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
right, keep on kidding me. It all helps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding. We will get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me more about this island. Well,
no, perhaps we had better be on our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising, they went to the window. A large
silver moon was tipping every wave with a
point of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t go to the lighthouse to-night.&rdquo;
There was a note of finality in the girl&rsquo;s voice.
&ldquo;The waves out there are as high as a house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;d better not venture out just now,
either. The moon&rsquo;s too bright. In an hour or
two there may be clouds. See, they are coming
in from the north.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And where shall we go when the clouds
are here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home.&rdquo; The girl whispered the word softly.
&ldquo;To my island home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIII</span>
<br />LIGHT ON THE WATER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;My island home,&rdquo; the girl said musingly.
&ldquo;How can I tell you about it so
that you will love it as I do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Isle Royale.&rdquo; She spread her arms
wide as if to gather its miles of wide expanse
into one embrace. &ldquo;Beautiful bays and tiny
lakes where the loon and the wild duck come
to build their nests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred enchanted islands where gulls
soar and scream at sundown, where the sea
hawk soars above you to complain in his shrill
voice of your intrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep dark pools beside the shelving rocks
where black shadows play and spotted trout
dart away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Isle Royale.&rdquo; Her eyes were dreamy
as she stared at the fire, that petite, vivacious
little lady, Berley Todd. &ldquo;This is the place
where I have always played my summer away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And to think&mdash;&rdquo; Her tone changed. &ldquo;To
think that those men might have killed me.
Then I would have played no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;never again to feel
the lift of my boat as I danced along in Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor or out on the open lake. Never
again to skim along before a gentle gale. Never
to climb the low mountains and look away,
away, away to where the blue begins!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; her tone became confidential,
&ldquo;we were always children on this island. Sometimes
we&rsquo;d take blankets and a grub box, boys
and girls together, four, six, ten, a dozen of
us, and tramp away to the top of Mount
Franklin. There, beside a fire on the rocks,
we watched the twilight fade and counted the
stars as they came out one by one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, rolling up in our blankets, we slept
beneath those stars. Playing all summer long.
Don&rsquo;t you love to play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Red slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have played! Football. You play
football. That&rsquo;s a game.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo; He smiled a curious smile. &ldquo;Well,
perhaps. But it&rsquo;s work, too, if you win. You
have to keep everlastingly at it. And the thing
you keep everlastingly at is pretty sure to seem
like work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Play,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;play all summer. Play
all winter would be good enough for me.&rdquo;
Football had taken its toll of his young life.
He was weary, desperately weary; not the
weariness that comes from a day of sudden,
arduous toil, to be dispelled by a night&rsquo;s repose,
but the dull, dragged-out weariness experienced
by an Arctic dog team after a five
hundred mile trek over the frozen snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; the girl demanded suddenly,
&ldquo;what do you like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I like?&rdquo; Red spoke slowly. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t tell you that. I can only tell you what I
have liked in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo; She laid her hand on his arm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said slowly, as if recalling some
scene in the remote past, &ldquo;this is what I have
liked: to stand before an open hearth in the
steel mill where twenty tons of scrap-iron, together
with limestone and tungsten, boil at
white heat; to reach in a long ladle and sample
it as the New England farmer samples his
maple syrup; to watch the sample cool, to
crack it with a hammer, to study its gleam;
to do this again and again until at last you
make a motion that says, &lsquo;The batch is done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then to throw a lever and watch that white
hot metal, twenty tons of it, pour into a massive
brick-lined pot of steel that hangs suspended
from a crane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;&rdquo; He paused to take a long breath.
The girl was staring at him with all her eyes.
&ldquo;Then to stand beneath that twenty tons of
molten steel and make the gesture that sets
flat cars in motion, flat cars loaded with forms
to receive the steel. Then to watch the white
hot steel pour once more; to follow its course
until the forms have been lifted off and the
billets of steel stand, red hot, sizzling in the
snow, row on row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her as if uncertain whether or
not to go on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes. Please?&rdquo; whispered Berley Todd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;To climb a steel stairway&mdash;&rdquo; He took a
fresh start. &ldquo;To seize a lever that swings a
crane. To lift a red hot billet of steel into its
place before heavy steel rollers, then to lift it
and toss it, to turn it and bump it, to roll it
here and roll it there, to press it and cut it,
then slide it to one side, a long, perfect steel
rail over which rich and poor, presidents and
princes may ride in safety. That,&rdquo; he ended,
&ldquo;has seemed to me a very large sample of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. And again, &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said never a word. For all that, he
sensed the fact that she had grasped the meaning
of all this and was glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go back to that,&rdquo; she said after a
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When studies and football are things of
the past. I hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll learn to love my island just a
little, won&rsquo;t you? And you will come back here
when summer has come and the loons are
nesting in Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor?&rdquo; There was pleading
in her voice. She loved Isle Royale. How
could others fail to love it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel,&rdquo; said Red with a curious smile, &ldquo;I
sort of feel that I will come, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look!&rdquo; He sprang to his feet. &ldquo;The
clouds are here. The moon has vanished. Time
to be going!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not now say: &ldquo;Where shall we go?&rdquo;
He knew they were to row up the bay half a
mile, then climb over a ridge to her family&rsquo;s
summer home. He was more than eager to
reach that home. Curiosity regarding that
home entered into that desire. But more than
that was the feeling that there she would
know of many places of hiding. And hide they
must until they could leave the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bring the boat around.&rdquo; He vanished
into the outer darkness.</p>
<p>Closing the door softly behind her, Berley
Todd stepped out upon the short platform
which served both as doorstep and dock.
What emotion surged through her being as
she stood alone there in the dark? Only she
could answer that.</p>
<p>Soon came the low dip-dip of oars, and they
were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better cross straight over,&rdquo; she said
in a low tone. &ldquo;Then we can follow the shore.
We&rsquo;ll come at last to a small landing. Better
try to keep in the shadows if the moon comes
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That this was wise counsel he was soon
enough to know.</p>
<p>Just as they reached the opposite shore the
moon, breaking through the clouds, painted
the channel with a million spangles of silver.</p>
<p>Swinging the boat about quickly, Red drew
it into the shadow of an overhanging cedar.</p>
<p>Resting there for a moment, they allowed
their eyes to wander back. There, lighted up
by the silver moon was the cabin that had offered
them sanctuary for a day. Would they
ever forget it? How could they?</p>
<p>And who would wish to forget so lovely a
picture? Great spruce trees towered toward
the sky. Half hidden by the lesser growth of
birch and balsam, the cabins stood. There were
three in all, yet in this uncertain light they
seemed but one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the loveliest spots on earth!&rdquo;
The girl took one long deep breath that came
near being a sob. &ldquo;It is so beautiful it seems
like a dream. Like a southern home beside a
river in a moving picture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man built it years ago. He built into it
all his love for nature and the great out-of-doors.
He had planned it that those he loved
might be happy there. And they have been
very, very happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t this world be wonderful if all
men were like that? If we lived for others
more than for ourselves? If no one were greedy
or ambitious for power? If we all lived the
life God has given us for the pure joy of living?&rdquo;
Then again she murmured, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like
some southern home.&rdquo; Her voice trailed off
into silence.</p>
<p>Then, after a moment, she began again, only
this time she was singing, singing so softly
that she would not waken a sleeping bird:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Carry me back to old Virginia,</p>
<p class="t0">The place where I was born.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>And then, as if the island home were but
a beautiful dream, the moonlight faded, leaving
all in darkness.</p>
<p>Once again Red Rodgers took up the oars
and they glided onward over the dark mysterious
waters of the night.</p>
<p>It was strange, this passing on and on into
the unknown. Water and air seemed to meet.
Did they ride in air or on water? What could
it matter?</p>
<p>Only the rough outline of tree tops served
to guide him. Off to the right a tiny island
loomed for a time, then faded into the night.</p>
<p>Before them some wild creature swam. Was
it duck or beaver? Who could say? Nothing
appeared to matter. All was swallowed up in
the mystery of the night.</p>
<p>Then, by a sudden flash of light, all was
changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; the girl whispered. &ldquo;There, to the
left, is the dock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment more and they glided silently
alongside the narrow platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie up here.&rdquo; The girl stepped from the
boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>Until this time they had not flashed a light.
Why did the girl flash Red&rsquo;s light now? Who
can say? She did throw it on for a second.
Instantly a low cry escaped her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Footprints!&rdquo; Dismay was registered
in her tone. &ldquo;They&mdash;they have gone before
us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true that the narrow circle of light
revealed the prints of a very large boot in the
snow. To the right of the dock a boat was tied.</p>
<p>The girl snapped off the light. For a moment
they stood there in silence side by side,
a moment only, then the girl gripped Red&rsquo;s
arm until it hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look! Look! Light on the water! They
are behind us and before!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some distance away, on the black surface
of the water a pale light shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I know a hundred
hiding places! We can best escape them here!&rdquo;
She led him to the foot of the hill, then began
to climb, leaving him to follow in the dark as
best he could.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIV</span>
<br />DREW LANE STEPS INTO SOMETHING</h2>
<p>That same night Drew Lane &ldquo;stepped
into something,&rdquo; something that was
quite unexpected and&mdash;well, you&rsquo;ll see.</p>
<p>During the day he had conducted his raids
on the city&rsquo;s two &ldquo;kidnaping centers.&rdquo; They
had turned out as he had prophesied they
might&mdash;quite tame affairs. Most of the gentlemen,
expecting a call, had stepped out. The
raids yielded three guns, sixteen pocket knives
and no information of importance regarding
the mysterious disappearance of the Red Rover.
Indeed the protestations of innocence, the
ready offer of assistance which he received on
every hand led him to believe that this was a
job pulled off by some one quite outside the
well-ordered circle of kidnaping gentlemen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, Lane, we don&rsquo;t know a thing!&rdquo;
one smooth-spoken gentleman assured him.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want the Red Rover snatched. Why
should we? Our money is up on him, a lot
of it. We want him to come through with a
touchdown, a whole flock of &rsquo;em. Tell you
what&mdash;&rdquo; His voice dropped to a whisper.
&ldquo;Your pay isn&rsquo;t too big. Know where you
can pick up a piece of change? I do. You just
step out and bring the Red Rover back. The
boys here will make up a purse for you. Just
you say: &lsquo;The Red Rover plays,&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll
hear the clink of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do men gamble on football?&rdquo; Drew had
opened his eyes wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do they? Why, say! They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But something&mdash;a wink, a thrust in the side,
a dark look, something&mdash;silenced the talkative
one. He said no more. He had said enough,
however, to put Drew in a thoughtful mood.</p>
<p>His collecting of pocket knives was received
on the whole as a huge joke. It was suggested
that he go out on a sand lot and take up a
jack-knife collection from the boys playing
ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Drew felt a bit silly about it himself and,
since he had no notion what purpose it was
intended to serve, he was tempted to chuck it.
In the end he carried it through. So sixteen
pocket knives all duly labeled reposed in the
drawer of his desk.</p>
<p>All of which has nothing whatever to do
with the thing he &ldquo;stepped into&rdquo; after darkness
had fallen.</p>
<p>He had gone into a place for a belated dinner.
This place, he knew, had a bad reputation.
That was why he wished to eat there.
A born detective, Drew was always looking
for things, and sometimes he found them.</p>
<p>Having ordered baked flank steak, French
fried potatoes, pie, and black coffee, he sat
back in his chair to stare dreamily about him.
He was truly hungry. &ldquo;Flank steak all filled
with dressing! Um!&rdquo; he whispered. Little
did he dream that the meal would never be
eaten.</p>
<p>Just before him eight men were grouped
around a double table. Their meal over, they
sat drinking amber liquid from tall glasses.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might be soda water,&rdquo; Drew mused. The
men were far more interesting than their drink.
They were a strange lot. Three of them, dark
complexioned gentlemen with short black
moustaches, looked exactly alike. They were
dressed alike and often all spoke at the same
time. They laughed together in a sort of symphonic
chorus. To the right of these was a
large man with a huge red nose who roared
when he laughed. A smaller and younger
man, who might well have been his son, sat
beside him. Across from these were two others
who did not fall under Drew&rsquo;s gaze.</p>
<p>The man at the end caught and held Drew&rsquo;s
attention. A small man, he said never a word,
but all the time sat poised as if for a spring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a jack-in-the-box,&rdquo; Drew told
himself.</p>
<p>This little man&rsquo;s eyes were roving from one
to another of his companions. Once, these
eyes, swinging in a wide circle, took Drew in.
Cold steel-gray eyes that glittered, they sent
a chill coursing down his spine. He felt in his
pocket. Yes, the safety on his automatic was
snapped off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>It was then that Drew&rsquo;s keen mind registered
an important fact. This little man with
the fiery eyes was branded, or so it seemed;
there was a double scar on the right side of
his forehead. Together these scars, one red,
the other purple, formed a Maltese Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him anywhere,&rdquo; Drew told himself.
&ldquo;And yet, those scars might be faked, little
touches of colored wax. It&rsquo;s been done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew was expecting something to happen.
The room was like a country place before a
thunderstorm. One expects the roar of it
long before the first peal comes rolling in.</p>
<p>When the thing did happen Drew was ready.
It was nothing much at that, you might say.
The little man half rose in his chair. As he did
so something heavy slipped from his pocket
and fell to the floor with a crash. It was a
blue-barreled automatic.</p>
<p>Without so much as glancing about, the
little man reached down to pick it up.</p>
<p>A look of pained surprise overspread his
face as he realized the gun was not on the
floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Then, as if a thought had struck him all of
a heap, he whirled about to fix his fiery eyes
on Drew Lane and to remark in a tone as
smooth and hard as glass:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did.&rdquo; Sliding back his chair, Drew
stood up, thrust both hands deep in his pockets,
then with a trick he had learned by long
practice, threw out the lapel of his coat to
display his star pinned underneath.</p>
<p>He said never another word&mdash;just stood
there smiling a little. What more was to be
said? The man had carried concealed weapons.
This he had no right to do. As an officer Drew
was doing his duty.</p>
<p>The little man&rsquo;s face went red all over, like
an angry sunset. His eyes swept the circle of
his companions and, as if attached to strings
held in his hand, they arose&mdash;the three all alike,
the big man, his son and the other two.</p>
<p>Drew Lane was young. But he was no novice.
He knew what it meant. He was prepared.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he spoke in an even tone, &ldquo;you
can take me. You are eight to one. But I&rsquo;ll
get two of you first.&rdquo; His eyes fell a trifle.</p>
<p>There was not a man in the group but read
his meaning. In his pockets were two automatics.
Time and again he had won the police
prize for straight shooting from the hips.
One false move and a member of the little
man&rsquo;s gang would get a bullet in his heart or
his brain. Drew was good for exactly two of
them.</p>
<p>It was a tense moment. Perhaps the glittering
eyes of that little man had never wavered.
Perhaps they would not have wavered
now. Who could say? No one. For at that
instant the lights went out, and on the instant,
save for the feeble light of one small window,
the place was dark.</p>
<p>A deep silence fell upon the room. Without
realizing it, Drew began counting under his
breath: &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five, six.&rdquo; Perhaps
he was counting the seconds before
things began to happen. Keeping a tight grip
with either hand on the things of blue steel
in his pockets, he waited, silent, breathless.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>He had just become conscious of a clock that
ticked loudly in a corner, when a low gasp
caught his attention.</p>
<p>Without knowing why, he fixed his eyes
upon the one small window. Other eyes were
fixed upon that narrow window. How many
pairs of eyes? Who could say? It was dark.</p>
<p>Something was moving by the window. Not
a person&mdash;no, surely not that! A skull perhaps,
an ugly skull with hollow eye sockets
from which a pale light gleamed. A sigh
passed over the room like the low moan of the
sea at night.</p>
<p>And then something stranger happened. The
skull disappeared and a ghost with bones
bleached white and a long, flowing sheet went
racing away across an empty space beside the
building. Again the long sigh swept across the
room.</p>
<p>And then the lights went on. These lights
disclosed eight gentlemen standing just as
they had stood before, staring rather stupidly
at one another&mdash;the three alike, the big man
and his son, the little one with glittering eyes
and the other two. Drew Lane had vanished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>For a full minute by the clock on the wall
they stood there staring at one another. Then
the big man said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Galloping Ghost!&rdquo; After which he let
forth a roar of laughter that suggested a crazy
baboon roaring in the night.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the place was raided by
the police. There was no one there.</p>
<p>One fact about this affair seems important.
Drew Lane retained possession of the automatic
that had fallen on the floor. This automatic
was the key to a situation. What situation?
This, for a while, was to remain a mystery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER XV</span>
<br />&ldquo;SHOOTIN&rsquo; IRONS&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As Red Rodgers followed the girl in the
dark over the narrow trail that led away
from the dock where they had discovered mysterious
footprints in the snow, he found himself
climbing what seemed to him an almost
perpendicular wall. Here he stumbled over a
boulder, there slipped on a stretch of earth
that appeared to stand on end, and here found
himself clawing madly in air for some form
of hand-hold. That the girl knew the trail well
enough became evident at once. She reached
the crest of the ridge far in advance of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here! Give me your hand,&rdquo; she breathed
as he came up. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so steep on this side.
Almost not steep at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red heaved a sigh of relief, then prepared
to follow on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>The trail was much longer on this side. It
seemed strange, this prowling about in the
darkness on an island he knew only by name.</p>
<p>As his eyes became more accustomed to the
darkness he made out vague black bulks to the
right and to the left. &ldquo;Trees,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>When one of these black bulks let out a low
grunt and vanished into the night, he stopped
short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose,&rdquo; the girl said in a low tone. &ldquo;All
over the island. Like the bears of Yellowstone.
That was probably old Uncle Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ned?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about him some time,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Dense darkness lay before them. The girl
plunged into this darkness, the shadow of a
narrow stretch of forest.</p>
<p>Red&rsquo;s ears caught the low murmur of water;
his gaze fell upon the white gleam of light
upon the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we&rsquo;ll go to the left. Lots of places
there to hide.&rdquo; Once again the girl led the
way, but not for long. Suddenly she stopped
dead in her tracks to whisper:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! A light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Red looked he caught a yellow gleam
that came filtering through the branches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what shall we do now?&rdquo; For the
first time the girl appeared at her wits&rsquo; end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That light comes from a cabin.&rdquo; Red tried
to think the thing out straight. &ldquo;Might be
best to try for a look. Then we&rsquo;ll know what
we&rsquo;re up against, at least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Except to give him her hand the girl made
no reply.</p>
<p>Slowly now, with pulses pounding, they
made their way forward.</p>
<p>To the left of the trail they saw a white bulk,
a cabin. They passed another. Then suddenly
he dragged the girl from the trail. An unexpected
sound had reached his ears, a dog&rsquo;s
bark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dog!&rdquo; Berley Todd shuddered. &ldquo;Why
would they bring a dog in the plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To track us. No wonder they were so sure
we wouldn&rsquo;t get away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But listen! That dog&rsquo;s inside. Let&rsquo;s go
back while there&rsquo;s a chance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be ten steps farther. I&rsquo;m for a
look. You&mdash;you stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not alone.&rdquo; She gripped his arm hard. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
go.&rdquo; It was she who led now.</p>
<p>A dozen paces more and they stood within
sight of the window through which the light
shone. And then a tall man, who was just in
the act of removing a ten gallon hat, moved
in front of the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s Ed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a melodious ring in the girl&rsquo;s
voice that told plainer than words that they
had found a friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed who? Who&rsquo;s Ed?&rdquo; Red was puzzled
by this fresh turn of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just Ed. A scout. He has a camp on the
island in summer. Always before he left with
the rest. But now he&rsquo;s here, and I&rsquo;m glad!&rdquo;
There was a ring of pure joy in her voice.
&ldquo;Now&mdash;now we are three, three of us and a
dog. Come on!&rdquo; She dragged him forward.
&ldquo;Come on before he turns that dog loose!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>As Berley flashed the light for an instant
the boy read, above the door:</p>
<p class="center">TRAILSIDE.</p>
<p>He wondered what that stood for. There
was no time now for talk. Berley&rsquo;s hard little
knuckles had made contact with the door.</p>
<p>The next instant they stood blinking in the
light that came from the cabin. Before them,
holding his dog by the collar, was a tall, well-built
man whose graying hair said he might be
forty. His face, though seamed and tanned
from constant exposure, bore the touch of
eternal youth, a heritage of those who spend
their lives in wild and silent places.</p>
<p>For a space of seconds he stared at them.
Then his face lighted with a smile as he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! It&rsquo;s the little half-portion, Berley
Todd! Put her there!&rdquo; He extended a brawny
brown hand.</p>
<p>Then, as if struck by a sudden thought, he
drew back and stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but what are you doing here at this
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Came by plane,&rdquo; Berley explained with a
laugh. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you hear us arrive?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; The look on the guide&rsquo;s face was
strange to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t of course. We came in the
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this&mdash;&rdquo; She pushed her companion
forward. &ldquo;This is the Red Rover. You&rsquo;ve
heard of him, haven&rsquo;t you? The famous football
star, the Red Rover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s?&rdquo; The guide continued to stare. It
was plain that he believed little of that which
he had just heard. And who could blame him?
What chance was there that the most famous
football star of the season should go off into
a wilderness in an airplane a few days before
the big game of the year?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold. We&mdash;we&rsquo;d like to come in,&rdquo; the
girl pleaded.</p>
<p>The scout stared for ten seconds, then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg pardon! Been a long time since any
one was here. Didn&rsquo;t expect to see a soul until
spring. Come in. Got a big kettle of Mulligan
stew on the stove. Big feed, what?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be too big for us!&rdquo; said Berley, closing
the door and, to the scout&rsquo;s bewilderment,
turning the key in the lock, as she said quite
calmly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to pull the shades if you don&rsquo;t
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Just pull &rsquo;em right down.&rdquo; The
scout stared afresh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; explained &ldquo;the little half-portion,&rdquo;
dropping into a chair, &ldquo;Red, here, and I
ran away. We&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want any one to
know we are here. Not a soul&mdash;except, of
course, you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the compliment, Miss. But I
assure you there&rsquo;ll not be a soul here until
spring. Do you plan to stay that long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muscles of Berley&rsquo;s mouth were twitching
desperately. It was great fun, this posing
as the stolen bride of a famous football star,
but bottling up her mirth was quite another
matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, we&mdash;&rdquo; She tried hard to steady
her voice. &ldquo;We&mdash;we haven&rsquo;t made any definite
plans, have we?&rdquo; She turned to Red.
Then, as if a second thought had taken possession
of her, she demanded:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Red, what did you do to that plane when
you left me out on the raft at the back of
Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took the breaker assemblies out of their
magnetos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever that means.&rdquo; She wrinkled her
brow in a peculiar way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; Red measured his words, &ldquo;that
they will have to send to the factory for parts
before they can fly; in other words, that they
can&rsquo;t leave the island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes it bad.&rdquo; Berley seemed worried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For us. They&rsquo;ll be after us night and day
to get those parts back. They&rsquo;ll not leave a
stone unturned. If we leave the island before
they do, they are trapped here. Even if they
reached the lighthouse no one would aid
them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the officers will come here after them.&rdquo;
Red went on where she left off. &ldquo;My old
friend, Drew Lane, will be here in his red racer.
Grand coup, I call it! A bit hazardous, but
what is life but a series of exciting adventures?
If you can make those adventures count for
good, why that&rsquo;s fine and dandy, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Beaming, Berley put out her hand.</p>
<p>Then, turning to the puzzled scout, she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Ed, you&rsquo;ve got us all wrong. We
haven&rsquo;t eloped. We&rsquo;ve been kidnaped, one at
a time, and have escaped together. Now Red
has got to get back to the gridiron for Saturday&rsquo;s
game and I to the bleachers. You are
elected to help us. You may get shot and all
that, but you&rsquo;ve got to come along. You&rsquo;ve
been drafted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Understanding very little of all this, but
game to the last, the scout threw open a cupboard
to drag down two huge pistols.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s shootin&rsquo;
irons. Inherited them from my dad. Never
had much use for &rsquo;em except to take a crack
at a prowlin&rsquo; coyote now and then, but I
reckon I can hit a tin can at fifty yards mighty
nigh every pop. And that&rsquo;s good enough for
coarse work. I&rsquo;m with you, little half-portion,
with you to the end.&rdquo; Then, as if she were a
child, he seized her about the waist and
bumped her head against the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mulligan&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he announced a moment
later. &ldquo;What am I really drafted into? You&rsquo;ll
tell me that, won&rsquo;t you, over the Mulligan stew
and coffee?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVI</span>
<br />THE BRANDED BULLET</h2>
<p>To inform you that Drew Lane made his
escape from a perilous position while the
Galloping Ghost was doing his bit would be
to waste words. There are times, of course,
when it is an officer&rsquo;s duty to stand his ground
and shoot it out with the outlaws who chance
to cross his path. This was not one of those
times. Drew Lane went for reinforcements.
That he did not return in time was an unavoidable
misfortune. He was obliged to content
himself with turning in a detailed report
of the affair together with an accurate description
of the individuals who composed the band.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d know that little fellow with the fiery
eyes anywhere,&rdquo; he said to Tom Howe, as he
sat at his desk. &ldquo;His scar marks him if nothing
else does.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But those three fellows that look just alike.
Suppose they scatter. How&rsquo;s a fellow to tell
which is which? Clever, I call it. Suppose one
is suspected of a stick-up. Suppose he&rsquo;s put
in the &lsquo;show up&rsquo; on Sunday morning. Then
suppose the victim says: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the man.&rsquo; But
suppose the other two are in the line and the
victim says again and yet again: &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the
man.&rsquo; And each time he&rsquo;s seeing a different
one. Which of the three will be tried and convicted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;d be a mix-up,&rdquo; Tom grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look, Tom.&rdquo; Drew placed a thing of
blue steel on the table. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the automatic
that the little fellow with fiery eyes dropped.
He&rsquo;s the sort that shoots on sight. He may
have done some shooting right here in town.
It might just happen that you&rsquo;ve got a bullet
in your collection that came from his gun.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might at that.&rdquo; Tom took the gun. &ldquo;Quite
a collection of bullets I&rsquo;ve got right now.
There&rsquo;s the one that stopped Patrolman
O&rsquo;Malley down by the Stock Yards. There&rsquo;s
the one that passed through the Chink&rsquo;s heart
and landed in a wall down in Chinatown. Six
or seven more. I&rsquo;ll try it out. Want to come
along, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson dropped the book he was
reading. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad to!&rdquo; Anything that had
to do with scientific crime detection might
claim this boy&rsquo;s attention, be it day or night.</p>
<p>Tom Howe and Johnny dropped down to
the basement where a bullet might be fired
into a barrel of sawdust without disturbing
the guests of the hotel. Drew finished his report,
dispatched it by a messenger and then,
having extinguished his lamp of gleaming
white light, switched on one of faint blue that
gave the whole place an air of spooky mystery.
It was thus that he could best think out
the problems which lay directly before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A whole day gone,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;And
what have we? A bed sheet taken from a sleeping
car. An invisible footprint on that sheet.
But whose footprint? Shall we ever know?
A bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>He spread out a sheet of paper to examine
it afresh. &ldquo;A second message from the dead,&rdquo;
he murmured. &ldquo;At least from the Galloping
Ghost. Pretty hard-fisted ghost at that.
Knocks Tom down; then when he is gone,
digs a bullet from some post or railway tie,
and presents it for our inspection. He says
here that the bullet is the one fired at Tom out
there by the Red Rover&rsquo;s sleeping car. &lsquo;Find
that man.&rsquo; And then&mdash;sure, find him if you
can!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this jack-knife business,&rdquo; he mused on.
&ldquo;The Ghost says one of the kidnapers has the
whittling habit, that while waiting for Red to
fall asleep he sat on a pile of ties and whittled
at a soft stick. A knife blade, he says, when
examined under a microscope shows some irregularities
on its edge, even the sharpest of
&rsquo;em. I suppose that&rsquo;s right. But what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat for some time in a brown study from
which he emerged with a start and a low exclamation:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to it! What? Might be a lot!
I&rsquo;ll have to get Tom digging into that. He and
his microscope have solved many a baffling
crime.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>Once again he settled back into meditation.
&ldquo;Speed boat tied up far down the river. Airplane
hangar nearby. Police have searched all
buildings near there. No result. Looks like an
airplane job. Spirited away in an airplane.
What could be simpler? Wonder if the night
mechanic at the airport knows anything? If
he does, like as not he wouldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing sure!&rdquo; He brought his chair
down with a bang. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get action,
and get it quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the evening paper he scanned its
front page. GHOST GALLOPS AGAIN
was sprawled across the front page. And below,
RED ROVER STILL MISSING. POLICE
HAVE NOTHING TO REPORT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Drew smiled grimly. &ldquo;Hold your
horses. We may report something yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he read, in smaller type: &ldquo;The public
is aroused by this daring crime. A large
purse is being raised as a reward for the return
of the Red Rover. The Midway coach is game.
He is drilling his team hard in the face of almost
certain defeat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad!&rdquo; Drew shook his head. &ldquo;Probably
his last great game. They say he is to
retire at the close of this season. Everything
was set for a glorious victory. And now this!
The plans wrecked by a gang of outlaws who
deserve nothing but to die horribly. And here
we are doing our best, working night and day,
following blind trails, getting nowhere. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke short off as a fist banged the door
and a voice demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up! Let me in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Johnny. As a bringer of good news
he had outstripped Tom Howe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew! Drew!&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
gun!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gun is which gun?&rdquo; Drew grinned
in spite of himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bullet fits that gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which bullet fits what gun? Sit down and
tell me about it.&rdquo; He pushed him into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>After a breathing spell Johnny was able to
tell a connected story. He and Tom Howe had
gone to the basement and had fired three bullets
from the gun Drew had picked up on the
floor of the place where, for a very good reason,
he had eaten no supper. Having fired the
bullets into sawdust, they had picked them out
and had examined them under the microscope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how it is,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Every
gun barrel has microscopic defects on the inside.
These leave their marks on the bullet.
The bullet left by the Galloping Ghost apparently
struck the steel car a glancing blow and
then entered a block of wood. One side was
flat, but the other showed its marking clearly.
And the scratches on that bullet, four of them,
clearly marked, exactly matched the ones fired
from the gun you took from that little fellow
with a branded forehead and fiery eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did!&rdquo; Drew dropped in a heap on a
chair. &ldquo;So that was the man! And I had him,
had him in my hands! And I let him go! What
a break!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny, as he recalled the circumstances,
was not sure whether Drew had had the little
man or the little man and his gang had had
Drew; but he said nothing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em yet!&rdquo; Drew
came to his feet with a bound. &ldquo;Get the Chief
on the wire. He&rsquo;ll send out a drag-net. A mob
like that can&rsquo;t cruise about this city without
being caught. They&rsquo;re marked men, every one
of them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was he right? Only time would tell.</p>

<br />JOHNNY&rsquo;S JIMMY</h2>
<p>In the meantime Red Rodgers, the object of
all this activity in a great city, sat at a
small table in a cozy cabin on Isle Royale, hundreds
of miles away, calmly sipping the broth
from a delicious Mulligan stew (which, by the
way, is made by cooking up everything you
have in the way of meat and vegetables, then
adding much sliced bacon and many onions).</p>
<p>The stew was good. The cabin was warm.
The hour was late. When Red had emptied
his bowl he sat back to nod drowsily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to be lazy and comfortable and to
do nothing,&rdquo; he murmured. It seemed to him
now that he had somehow been drugged.
Never before had he felt so little desire for
action. &ldquo;I wish those crooks would leave us
alone,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;I wish I could
sleep for a week.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>But what was this? A voice sounded in the
room, a strange voice. And what was this man
saying?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The listening world will be interested to
know that while the football star, officially
known as the Red Rover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red&mdash;Red Rover.&rdquo; The boy sat up, quite
awake now. &ldquo;Why, that is the radio! They&rsquo;re
talking about me. And here I am listening in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the scout chuckled, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Chicago.
Haven&rsquo;t listened to that station before, or I&rsquo;d
have known. Bet they&rsquo;re broadcasting reports
every hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? You&rsquo;re a star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A star to-day; to-morrow a steel mill worker.
What does one star more or less matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For all that, he sat up and listened with increasing
interest as the speaker told of all
that was being done to apprehend the kidnapers
and return the Rover to his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good old Drew Lane,&rdquo; he murmured.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em. You&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>But after all&mdash;. His spirits drooped. After
all, what could it matter? He might discover
who the kidnapers were. But would he trace
them to Isle Royale? Ah, no. That was expecting
too much!</p>
<p>He felt a tightening at his throat as he
thought of his team mates and the coach, the
Grand Old Man, doing their best to stave off
defeat. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m so important as an
individual,&rdquo; he told himself humbly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
part of the piece, like one stone in an arch.
Without me the team must fail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why am I here?&rdquo; he cried out suddenly,
springing to his feet. &ldquo;How can I get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the guide said quietly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do the best we can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The guide blew out the lamp,
then quietly opened the door. Bing, the dog,
uttered a low growl. He was silenced by his
master.</p>
<p>From somewhere away off in the dark came
a weird, wild call. It was answered here and
answered there. Then such a chorus as never
before was heard on sea or land rose above the
sound of rushing water and sighing pines.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wolves,&rdquo; Ed commented briefly. &ldquo;Bush
wolves. Hundreds of &rsquo;em on the island.
They&rsquo;re all singing to-night. There will be a
storm. Listen again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a little sea to-night. To-morrow
it will be raging. The distance from Rock of
Ages on this island to the mainland is seventeen
miles. Rock of Ages is forty miles from
here. There are power boats here, but no gasoline.
You&rsquo;d have to row. You&rsquo;d never make
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our only chance is Passage Island,&rdquo; Berley
Todd put in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely! But that is four miles from
Blake&rsquo;s Point. Four miles of raging black
waters. And Lake Superior never gives up her
dead. No. No, son. You&rsquo;ll be staying here a
spell yet. And why not? Really you should see
a little of Rock Harbor while you&rsquo;re here.
That&rsquo;s what they say in summer.&rdquo; He laughed.
&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>Red was to see something of Rock Harbor
indeed. Pictures of this unusual little corner
of the world were to hang for many a day on
the walls of his memory. Some of these he
would cherish, and some he would be glad to
forget.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Next morning, in the distant city, there
was a council of war. Drew Lane, Tom Howe
and Johnny Thompson sat around Drew&rsquo;s
desk. Coffee had been sent up in a tin pail.
They were imbibing freely as they talked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police drag-net caught never a thing,&rdquo;
Drew announced. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve vanished, all that
gang belonging to the fiery-eyed fellow, the
big man and his son, the three just alike, and
the two others. And that,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;leaves
us just where we were. We have the gun that
was fired at you, Tom, but we haven&rsquo;t the
man. The Red Rover is still a captive. And
why? Will you answer me that? Have the authorities
over at Old Midway received demands
for ransom money?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a scratch.&rdquo; Tom&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;Had them on the wire half an hour ago.
There&rsquo;s another case up just now, too; just as
strange in a way. Little lady named Berley
Todd; old man Todd&rsquo;s daughter, steel magnate,
or something of the sort. Not a word
from her either, though that&rsquo;s not our problem.
We&rsquo;re out to find the Red Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and that promises to be enough to
keep us awake nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone changed, &ldquo;did you ever
hear of a pocket knife convicting a man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stabbing case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, whittling, just plain whittling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes. Let me see. There was one. A
fellow shot a former partner of his. Trapper
he was, I think. He built a blind of green willow
branches. Cut the branches with his
pocket knife. Shot the fellow behind this
blind. The sheriff found the blind. Then he
found the knife in the fellow&rsquo;s cabin. He sent
the knife and willow stubs to the Crime Laboratory.
They studied the knife blade and the
cuttings. That was the knife all right; irregularities
in the cuttings were the same as on the
knife blade. The trouble was, they couldn&rsquo;t
prove that the knife had not been planted in
the fellow&rsquo;s cabin, so the thing fell through.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds interesting.&rdquo; Drew drained his cup.
&ldquo;Wish you&rsquo;d take a look at these through your
microscope.&rdquo; He pushed a handful of shavings
toward his partner. &ldquo;The Galloping Ghost left
them, you remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here is the collection of pocket knives.
You&rsquo;ll be able to tell whether one of these did
the whittling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;some fellow connected
with the kidnaping sat and whittled
while he waited for the Red Rover to fall
asleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange how often men&rsquo;s habits convict
them,&rdquo; he philosophized. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re a whittler
you&rsquo;ll have your knife out on every occasion,
whittling, just whittling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he took up a shaving, &ldquo;must be
a nervous sort. See how short these are. If
he were a meditative person, quite at ease, he
would take long, smooth strokes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look these over.&rdquo; Tom swept the shavings
into an envelope. &ldquo;There might be something
in it. Can&rsquo;t afford to neglect the least
clue. If it interests the old G.G. it should have
our attention. By the way, what&rsquo;s your idea
about this Galloping Ghost? Who is he? And
what&rsquo;s he after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You answer.&rdquo; Drew grinned. &ldquo;All I know
is that he seems to be on our side. That&rsquo;s
enough for the present. I&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful!&rdquo; He turned suddenly to Johnny.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bend that. It might be important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; The boy held up a thin bit of
sheet aluminum that had been pressed into a
curious form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; Tom explained, &ldquo;is an impression
taken from the bottom of a sleeping car window.
When the Red Rover was kidnaped the
window was jimmied. The end of the bar made
a deep impression in the wood. It was an old
bar with several nicks in it. If I ever come
upon it I could identify it by this impression.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;is getting too deep for
me. Invisible footprints on sheets. Shavings
from some whittler&rsquo;s knife. Impressions in
wood. These are to bring a man to justice.
Pipe dreaming, I call it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I have a jimmy
bar all my own. Saved it from a watery
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stepping to the corner he produced a paper-wrapped
package and then revealed the bar he
had taken from the speed boat of Angelo Piccalo,
Junior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look!&rdquo; Tom Howe&rsquo;s eyes fairly
bulged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boy!&rdquo; he cried ten seconds later.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the bar! Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what do you mean? The bar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it&rsquo;s the bar that pried that car window
open. See! The impression fits exactly.
I say! Where&rsquo;d you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to get excited about,&rdquo; Johnny
grumbled. &ldquo;Some one stuck it in the back of
Angelo&rsquo;s speed boat. Young Angelo, you
know, son of the flower shop man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back of the boy&rsquo;s speed boat. Humph!&rdquo;
Slouching down in his chair, Tom fell into a
brown study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll dig into this whittling business,&rdquo; he
said, at last rousing himself. &ldquo;There might be
something in it. You never can tell.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER XVIII</span>
<br />DREAMING AT DAWN</h2>
<p>After ten winks caught in the scout&rsquo;s cozy
cabin, Red Rodgers and Berley Todd were
up before dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of the bush wolves as
weather prophets,&rdquo; Red said in a hoarse whisper.
He was ever conscious that their lives
were in danger. &ldquo;What a morning! We must
get a rowboat and be away for Passage
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the light of day?&rdquo; The girl pressed his
arm hard. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d see us. Then all would be
at an end. But no, perhaps not. There are
islands, small islands all in a row that lie half
a mile off this main shore. Once behind those,
we would be hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look. Which way is the
shore?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Over this way.&rdquo; The girl led him down a
path that, circling a clump of bushes, led them
past a group of buildings that loomed large
in the blue-gray dawn.</p>
<p>They passed through tall grass drenched
with dew, to climb at last a pile of rocks and
finally reach a great boulder that overlooked
the water.</p>
<p>In this moment of hushed silence just before
dawn, the water was like glass, smooth white
glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter? We must find a
boat at once.&rdquo; Red turned his eyes upon the
girl.</p>
<p>He realized at once that she had not heard
him. She was listening instead for some sound
that must come from far away.</p>
<p>Without willing it, he also listened; heard
it, too, a long, deep, long-drawn sigh. No human
sigh was this, but the sigh of great waters.
He heard it again and yet again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if Father Superior were waking
from his sleep,&rdquo; the girl whispered. &ldquo;It tells
of a coming storm. We must not go. We must
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>They had not long to wait. As the water
took on the faint pink of dawn a mist appeared
to rise from afar and to steal upon them.</p>
<p>One by one the distant points of land became
misty suggestions, mere ghosts of earth.
Like ten thousand great white fish leaping in
the sea, two miles away white-caps appeared,
while in the foreground with the gray-black
sky as a reflecting mirror, the water took on
a startling clearness.</p>
<p>Gulls ceased to soar and scream. Settling
upon a rocky ledge, they stood erect, silent,
like uniformed officers observing the outcome
of a battle. From time to time a member of
the party, some aid-de-camp, came soaring in
to report the results of his observation.</p>
<p>And all the time ten thousand spots of
gleaming white advanced. Now they were two
miles away, a mile and a half, a mile, half a
mile. Like some dirigible swept from its mooring,
a fragment of cloud detached itself from
the vast mass and came sweeping over. It left
in its wake a disturbing chill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>And now the spots of white lay before them,
at their very feet. A burst of wind swept the
hair back from the girl&rsquo;s temples. The wind
increased in volume. Waves began beating at
the rocks. A few large rain drops spattered.</p>
<p>And then, with a suddenness that was startling,
the storm broke. Rain came down in
torrents. Wind twisted at the birches, and set
all the spruces whispering and sighing. The
ever-increasing roar of water on the rocks vied
with the din of crashing thunder. The sky,
laced and interlaced by lightning, revealed itself
as some vast shroud. There are no storms
like the storms of November.</p>
<p>But even the fury of nature is futile. Men
do not agree upon man&rsquo;s destiny. No more
does nature agree upon its own. Rain beating
upon the water subdued it. White water vanished.
The beating of waves subsided. Having
outdone itself, in its mad fury, the wind
swept the clouds to other lands and other
waters. A brief half hour and a scene of surpassing
beauty, a tiny world studded with diamonds
lay before the waiting pair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is over,&rdquo; Red whispered from the depths
of a great spruce where they had found shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For now,&rdquo; came the girl&rsquo;s experienced reply.
&ldquo;For all that, we do not stir from this
spot. Superior has moods all its own. And
remember, Superior never gives up its dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leading the way out from their sheltered
nook, she perched herself upon a high rock.
Red took a place beside her. When she spoke
again a dreamy look had overspread her countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, spreading her arms wide,
&ldquo;this is Isle Royale. Forget the drifting leaves,
the gray tossing branches. It is summer now.
Night has come and a great golden moon
paints a patch of silver down the bay. The
rippling water seems alive. Every tiny wave
bears a tinier craft upon its bosom&mdash;the silver
schooner of a fairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen! From far down the bay comes,
wafted on by the breeze, the faintest suggestion
of a song. What is it, the whisper of a
bird talking to his mate?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. There comes the put-put of a motor,
yet even this seems to keep time to the music
that, gathering power and sweetness, floats on
and on down the bay. A craft appears. All
white in the moonlight, it seems as unreal as
a fairy&rsquo;s dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange men who drift about our island in
tiny gas boats. Like gypsies they are. They
are here. Who are they? You do not care to
know. Where did they come from? The mines,
the forests, the pulp mills perhaps. This does
not matter. They are here. They have a tune
for you. They belong to the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, with the moon hanging high, they drift
down that silver patch of moonlight to vanish
into the night. And still, long after they are
lost from sight, comes wafted in by the wind
and waves faint, sweet music that one cannot
forget. This,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;is Isle Royale in
summer. And you have not seen it, and have
never heard it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this&mdash;&rdquo; Red smiled down at her.
&ldquo;All this is play. And I never play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you will! You must!&rdquo; she exclaimed
in a breath. &ldquo;You will play with me here. See!
A storm is rising, a three days&rsquo; storm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See! It is light. We are in danger! We
must hurry back to our refuge.&rdquo; Like a gleam
of white light she was away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER XIX</span>
<br />NIGHT ON ISLE ROYALE</h2>
<p>Once again it was night on Isle Royale.
All day a wild south-easter had lashed
the waters of Lake Superior into foam. All
day in the scout&rsquo;s cabin Red Rodgers and Berley
Todd had waited for that which they felt
to be inevitable&mdash;the arrival of the kidnapers
and the battle that must follow. Or would
there be a battle? The snow had melted. No
footprints remained. Perhaps Ed could make
the outlaws believe they were not there.</p>
<p>For a time after a breakfast of sour dough
flapjacks they sat discussing possibilities. After
that, overcome by their long vigil, they
slept.</p>
<p>Now that night had come, they were as wide
awake as night owls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough to be waiting without knowing
what they are about,&rdquo; Red exploded at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost rather meet them face to face and
fight it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! Not that!&rdquo; The girl shuddered.
&ldquo;But we might have a look at them from the
Palisades. Surely we&rsquo;d not meet them on that
trail. And, if we should, we could lose ourselves
on the instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Safe enough,&rdquo; Ed commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the Palisades?&rdquo; Red rose as if
prepared to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The highest point on this ridge,&rdquo; the guide
explained. &ldquo;Trees are cut away there. You
can look down a hundred feet to Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor.
Their camp&rsquo;s back there. If there&rsquo;s a light
showing they will still be in camp. If one
moves on the water, you&rsquo;ll know they are out
looking around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for me to go,&rdquo; he added, nodding
at Berley Todd. &ldquo;She knows every step of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the dark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the dark. But there&rsquo;s a little light. Better
take your flashlight. Don&rsquo;t use it unless
you have to.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>A short time later two dusky figures stole
out into the night, a tall one and a short one.</p>
<p>In silence they passed through a narrow
fringe of spruce, birch and balsam with here
and there a cottage looming black and silent
in the dark.</p>
<p>Once the girl seized Red&rsquo;s arm to point
through a clump of shapely spruce trees.
&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she whispered impressively, &ldquo;is my
home&mdash;my summer home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the storm keeps up, shall we go there,
perhaps to-morrow night, you and I and Ed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They mounted a low hill, then followed
along a tree-grown ridge. He marveled at her
ability to find her way in the dark. &ldquo;Great
little sport, this one,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Not
soft like so many girls.&rdquo; This was true. The
hand that gripped his arm was as hard and
muscular as a boy&rsquo;s. So was her arm.</p>
<p>In his mind&rsquo;s eye he saw Lake Superior
flecked with foam, four miles of it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going
to be tough, at best.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; the girl whispered in his ear. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
just up there. The trail&rsquo;s almost straight up.
Follow me. Be sure of your footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dark form loomed above him, but from
her lips came no panting breath. &ldquo;Fit,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;As fit as a marathon runner.&rdquo;
A moment of wild scrambling and he stood
beside her. At that instant the clouds parted
and, for a space of seconds, the harbor lay beneath
them in all the dark, majestic beauty of
a moonlight night. Almost directly beneath
them, a golden ball, lay the reflection of the
moon. Off to the left a dark bulk loomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Island.&rdquo; Berley caught her breath as she
whispered: &ldquo;Kidnaper&rsquo;s island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a black cloud obscured the light and
the harbor. The distant shore lay beneath
them, a vast well of darkness.</p>
<p>Darkness? Not quite all. From the far end
of that long, narrow island on which their log
prison stood, a pale yellow light shone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are there,&rdquo; the girl whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least some of them,&rdquo; Red amended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go down this way.&rdquo; Once again
the girl led.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>In time they came to a spot Red recognized,
the short dock at which they had disembarked
on the previous night. The rowboat they had
taken from the island still bumped at the dock.</p>
<p>To Red, reared as he had been close to the
slips where rusty ore boats lay at anchor, a
boat, any sort of boat, had an all but irresistible
appeal.</p>
<p>Apparently some such spell hung over the
girl, for when he gave her his hand to help
her into the boat she did not say, &ldquo;No, no! We
dare not.&rdquo; Instead, she whispered: &ldquo;We will
glide along in the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The oars made no sound. Sky and water
seemed one. To the girl, as she sat in the stern,
they appeared to float in air.</p>
<p>And then, all in a flash, this stillness was
shattered. The prow of their boat struck some
solid object with a dull thud. That same instant
it reared high in air to pitch the dreaming
girl into cold, black waters of night.</p>
<p>Paralyzed by the suddenness of it all, the
boy, riding high in air but still clinging to his
seat, saw her go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>For a space of seconds he hung there in midair.
Then with a dull splash the boat fell once
more to the water. At that same instant he
saw that which caused him to rub his eyes and
stare. At a speed quite impossible for a swimmer
of the girl&rsquo;s skill or strength she was
streaking away across the water toward an
island that loomed out of the dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A trap,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They&mdash;they got
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the oars, he swung the boat about
and began rowing madly.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>It was during this same hour that Johnny
Thompson happened upon something that
mystified him more than he was willing to admit.
This affair might have ended badly but
for the boy&rsquo;s splendid physique and careful
training.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>He was about to pass over the river bridge
on his way home when his eye was caught by
a brilliant display of flowers in Angelo Piccalo&rsquo;s
window. Coming to a halt, he stood
there studying the flowers for some little time.
&ldquo;Some flowers I never saw,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Have to ask Angelo about them. Those red,
heart-shaped ones and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts broke off. Two men, having
crossed the bridge, hesitated a moment, then
went down the stairway leading to the breakwater
landing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;at this hour
of the night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he lingered his wonder grew, for two
more men appeared from the dark bridge and
descended into the depths below, and after
these came three others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a look,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>As he shifted his position a door at the foot
of the stairs opened and a man disappeared.
&ldquo;Odd sort of business. A door opens. No light
comes out. Yet the man goes in. Something
wrong about that. That&rsquo;s beneath Angelo&rsquo;s
flower shop. He&rsquo;s my friend. I&rsquo;ll have a glimpse
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>His glance inside netted nothing but darkness.
Putting out a hand, he pressed against
a surface that yielded&mdash;a silent, swinging
door.</p>
<p>At once he was in a large, smoke-filled room.
A curious place it was, fitted with tables and
a counter; yet there was apparently nothing
to sell.</p>
<p>A strange feeling of discontent appeared to
hover over the room. Johnny felt a desire to
vanish. He resisted this to stare at the men
who sat about in groups grumbling in monotones
and at two who complained loudly in a
strange language to a large, poker-faced man
leaning over the counter.</p>
<p>All this will remain in the boy&rsquo;s mind as a
scene from some mystery drama, for a rough
voice at his ear said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Startled, he looked at the speaker. He was
almost twice Johnny&rsquo;s size. And he had help.
A companion stood at his side. Together they
glared at the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I walked in,&rdquo; he said in deliberate tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, walk out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so? This is Angelo&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be, and it may not. Out you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seizing the boy by the shoulder, they pushed
him through the folding doors and, following,
gave him a sudden shove and a vicious kick
that landed him outside.</p>
<p>It was a brutal and cowardly act. Unfortunately
for the perpetrator, he followed halfway
through the door. Like a flash of light,
Johnny was on his feet. The next instant his
left arm was about the big man&rsquo;s neck with a
vise-like grip that both choked and silenced
him in one act. Next Johnny&rsquo;s good right
played a tattoo on the other&rsquo;s face. He went
down like a log. With a deft twist, Johnny
pitched him into the river.</p>
<p>Just in time he caught the shadow of the
second man as he leaped toward him. Dropping
like a deadfall, he stopped the headlong
plunge of the man and sent him to join his pal
in the river where they did a spluttering act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coarse lot!&rdquo; Johnny grumbled. &ldquo;On second
thought, I&rsquo;ll not stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Climbing the stairs, he vanished into the
night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>This affair was to linger in his memory.
What place was this? What were those men
doing there? Some were grumbling, some smiling.
Why? Was this Angelo&rsquo;s place? It
couldn&rsquo;t be. But it was beneath his flower
store. Would he rent the space to such men
if he knew their nature?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally he wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Johnny assured
himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to him about it next time
I see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This resolve was never carried out. Before
he chanced upon Angelo&rsquo;s flower shop again,
strange discoveries were made. These discoveries
were to change his entire course of action.</p>

<br />RIDING A MOOSE</h2>
<p>As Red Rodgers raced after the floating figure
of the girl he gained little by little.
Boat length by boat length he decreased the
distance. Now she was twenty yards away,
now ten, now five, as he pulled madly at the
oars.</p>
<p>And then, as he glanced over his shoulder
a cry of surprise and dismay escaped his lips.
With a snort and a mad splashing of water a
dark bulk sprang from the water, rattled over
the pebbly shore, and then disappeared into the
dense forest that covered the narrow island.</p>
<p>For one full minute he looked in vain for
Berley Todd. Then, catching the sound of
what seemed a low laugh, he whirled about to
find her two white hands clinging to the prow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please give me a hand!&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
soaked. And boo! It&rsquo;s so cold!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I always wanted to do it,&rdquo; she chuckled as
she tumbled into the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; Red was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride a moose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ride&mdash;a&mdash;moose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Didn&rsquo;t you know it was done? Easy
enough. All you have to do is to find one
swimming and run him down with a canoe or
an outboard motor, and then hop overboard
and seize him by the antlers. As long as he
is in the water he can&rsquo;t harm you. But on
shore, just look out!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; she added quietly, as Red once more
swung the boat about and rowed for shore,
&ldquo;was Old Uncle Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Uncle Ned? Oh, yes, you spoke of him
once before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s huge, and is quite a character on the
island. Comes coughing around timid ladies&rsquo;
windows at night.&rdquo; She laughed quietly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you ran into him he must have been
feeding on grass off the bottom. He came up
quick and pitched me out. Somehow I was
thrown on top of him, and I got hold of his
antlers. The rest was too good to lose, so I
just hung right on and took a ride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; she ended quite meekly, &ldquo;that you
don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no.&rdquo; Red was rowing hard. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll
be frozen before we reach the cabin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o nn-o.&rdquo; The girl strove in vain to prevent
her teeth from chattering. &ldquo;I-I&rsquo;m all&mdash;all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The instant they touched the dock she was
out of the boat and on the dock doing a wild
dance. She stopped suddenly right in the
midst of this to stare away at the black water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what&rsquo;s moving over there?&rdquo; She sank
away into the shadows.</p>
<p>For a time Red could discover nothing.
Then it seemed to him that he did make out
something moving close to the surface of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be a boat. Perhaps we had better&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; She whispered excitedly. &ldquo;It <i>is</i> a
boat!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>Suddenly a bright light shone across the
water. A figure crouching behind the light
was faintly seen. He was in the prow of a
boat.</p>
<p>But now the thing within that circle of light
caught and held their attention. A moose,
splendid in his glory of shapely body and wide-spreading
antlers, stood at the point of the
island. Apparently blinded by the light, he
stood there like a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How perfect!&rdquo; Red breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monarch of the forest!&rdquo; the girl whispered
low.</p>
<p>And then stark tragedy came crashing
across the waters. A high-power rifle roared.
The moose leaped high and then fell with a
splash into the black water. The light blinked
out, and again all was night.</p>
<p>As if to escape the sight, Berley Todd turned
and glided silently up the hill. She was closely
followed by the Red Rover.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>While the Red Rover and Berley Todd were
meeting with strange adventures on the &ldquo;Mystic
Isle,&rdquo; Drew Lane and his companions were
striving in vain to unravel the tangled skein
of mystery that surrounded their disappearance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s gone haywire!&rdquo; Drew exclaimed
disconsolately, thrusting out his feet
before him and staring moodily at his littered
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Johnny
Thompson put in hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just exactly as bad, and worse!&rdquo; Drew
struck the desk a blow with his fist that set
even a &ldquo;Meditating Buddha&rdquo; dancing. &ldquo;Why,
look at it; we raid two well-known headquarters,
and what do we get? A quart of pocket
knives. The Galloping Ghost suggests that
we whittle soft wood with each one of these,
then examine the cuttings for irregularities on
the edge of the knife, after which we are to
compare each with the shavings found on the
night of the now famous kidnaping. And what
do we find? Exactly nothing. The whittling
was not done by any one of these knives. So
back they go. And where are we? Nowhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief&rsquo;s yelling his head off. People are
saying the police are asleep. Daily papers are
impatient. University people are furious. The
Red Rover is still a captive, and each day
brings the great game nearer. Football! Why
did anyone ever invent the game?&rdquo; He sprang
to his feet and began pacing the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did they kidnap Red anyway?&rdquo; he demanded
fiercely. &ldquo;I ask you that. No ransom
money has been demanded. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Johnny, &ldquo;they mean
to wait until the very day of the game. They
may figure that is the psychological moment
for making a demand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There might be something to that,&rdquo; Drew
said earnestly. &ldquo;Might be a lot. And if there
is&mdash;&rdquo; Once again his voice rose. &ldquo;If there is,
we&rsquo;ve got to get them before that time comes!
Kidnaping&rsquo;s been too easy. Too many soft-livered
millionaires have paid large sums for
their release or the release of some child.
We&rsquo;ve got to give &rsquo;em a lesson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are you to get them?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We must find a way. There&rsquo;s still that invisible
footprint on the sleeping car bed sheet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s my jimmy bar,&rdquo; said Johnny
hopefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the very bar, right enough. But
where did you find it? In the speed boat of a
boy in his &rsquo;teens. You can&rsquo;t very well pin a
super-kidnaping on a mere boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly, &ldquo;and you
wouldn&rsquo;t want to. Young Angelo is a fine
chap. Good looking, and all that. Got everything&mdash;speed
boat&mdash;going to have a faster one&mdash;big
car&mdash;going to college, and all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that?&rdquo; Drew sat up and stared at him.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t know there was that much in the cut
flower business, not these days. Flowers, you&rsquo;d
say, are a luxury. And luxuries have been hit
hard. Guess I&rsquo;ll quit being a cop, and go in for
flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought of the rough reception accorded
him in the place beneath the flower
shop, and wondered a big wonder. Should he
tell Drew about that? Well, perhaps, some
time. Not now. He hadn&rsquo;t quite thought the
thing through yet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But the man with the scar and the fiery
eyes!&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got the goods
on him. That was his gun. He fired that shot
at Tom, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he fired the shot. But he&rsquo;s vanished
off the earth, so far as we can see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; he added, pushing a sheet of
paper toward the boy, &ldquo;besides, there is this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old G.G. again!&rdquo; Johnny said, catching
his breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None other. Read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Drew Lane: You are on the wrong track. The
man who fired the shot was not the kidnaper.
For his motives consult the Rogues&rsquo; Gallery. The
trail you seek leads north.</i></p>
<p><span class="jr">&ldquo;<i>The G.G.</i>&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;North!&rdquo; Drew exploded. &ldquo;How far north?
Which way? How? By train, plane or boat?
If he wishes to help us, why doesn&rsquo;t he be
more explicit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Johnny, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all he
knows at present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;we ourselves
might go on from there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, in the newspaper offices
they have what they call an Exchange Department.
Papers from all over the world are on
file there. If a fellow went there and studied
all the papers published up north in Michigan,
Wisconsin, Minnesota and Canada, he might
discover a clue. Some paragraph telling of
some mysterious occurrence might just put a
fellow on the right track.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone was dubious.
&ldquo;Sounds a little like it came out of a book.
But you go ahead and try it. Jimmie Drury
over at the News will see that you get a look
at the files. Tell him I sent you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And while you&rsquo;re on the ramble, just drop
over to the State Street Station and see if you
can find the picture of a crook with a cross
branded on his temple. Old G.G. suggested
that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am beginning to
think of that Galloping Ghost! I think he&rsquo;s a
fake! Or even worse, a crook that&rsquo;s giving us
a bum steer, throwing us off the trail. I&rsquo;ve
more than half a notion to burn every other
love letter he sends us before I read it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Because, look!&rdquo; Once more he was pacing
the floor. &ldquo;If an honest fellow was wearing a
sheet and posing as a ghost, if he had some
real information about a case like this&mdash;one
that interests the whole country&mdash;why
wouldn&rsquo;t he let us in on his secret, come right
round in his street clothes and tell us his
story? What I say is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke straight off to stare at the door.
Some one had begun rattling it violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny, see who&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXI</span>
<br />THE SHOE</h2>
<p>Red Rodgers and Berley Todd lost no
time in making their way back to the
scout&rsquo;s cabin. If those men who blinded and
shot the moose were the kidnapers then they
were safest under the protection of Ed&rsquo;s
&ldquo;shootin&rsquo; irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those men,&rdquo; Ed said, when he had heard
their story, &ldquo;more&rsquo;n likely were not your kidnapers
at all. Moose hunters, more&rsquo;n likely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moose hunters!&rdquo; Berley Todd exploded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not allowed to kill a moose on Isle
Royale!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said you were?&rdquo; Ed threw back his
head and laughed. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re not allowed to
kidnap star football players and little half-portions
like you, but here you are all the
same!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Case is not parallel though,&rdquo; he added
thoughtfully. &ldquo;These men who come to the
island for moose need the meat to feed their
families; anyway that&rsquo;s their excuse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s good enough excuse for me!&rdquo; he
added emphatically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m neither deputy nor
game warden. I&rsquo;m here to guard the buildings
of this resort from fire and theft. If I interfere
with these moose hunters I&rsquo;m likely to be
found cold and stiff under the snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is a shame!&rdquo; Berley said quietly.
&ldquo;Moose are such magnificent creatures! And
Isle Royale is about the only place you can
see them. Think of the hundreds who come to
the island every year just to see them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-e-s,&rdquo; Ed drawled, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of them
and I&rsquo;ve wondered why the moose are not protected
in winter. But that distinctly ain&rsquo;t my
job. So there you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure those men were not members
of the kidnaping band. There must be
batteries and spotlights on the plane. They
could hook those up and use them. They&rsquo;ll be
needing meat. Why shouldn&rsquo;t they hunt
moose?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Might be, but I doubt it.&rdquo; Ed stirred the
fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Berley Todd, as a sudden
thought took possession of her. &ldquo;Suppose
those were moose hunters. Suppose they were
to meet the kidnapers. Suppose they think the
kidnapers are wardens and deputies; and the
kidnapers think they&rsquo;re detectives from the
city. Suppose they meet and shoot it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then suppose we come upon them all
dead with their boots on,&rdquo; Red drawled.
&ldquo;They do that in the movies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed,&rdquo; he demanded, &ldquo;when will this storm
end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red stared angrily at the fire. The girl
threw him a teasing glance as she sang low:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, play with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; he exclaimed almost fiercely,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll play with you to-morrow and the day
after if need be; anyway until the kidnapers
catch up with us or we are able to leave the
island.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you care to row,&rdquo; Ed suggested, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not
too rough in the harbor. If you were to wear
my canvas coat and cowboy hat&mdash;&rdquo; He turned
to Red. &ldquo;If you went out before dawn and if
Berley, here, sat low in the stern, no one would
know but that it was just old Ed and his dog.
You could play around among the little islands
all day and be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; Berley&rsquo;s tone was almost wistful.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take a lunch and eat it on the
rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be worse,&rdquo; Red admitted. &ldquo;Rowing
will at least keep me in trim for the great day.
And now for some sleep!&rdquo; He disappeared behind
the narrow curtain that led to one of the
cubby-hole bedrooms in Ed&rsquo;s cabin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The great day,&rdquo; he whispered to himself,
as he slid beneath the covers. That day now
seemed very, very far away. But quite unconsciously
he was losing his feeling of long
weariness. The spring of youth was flooding
back through every nerve and fiber of his being.
&ldquo;If only I could get a whack at that line,&rdquo;
he thought dreamily. &ldquo;If only I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The person banging at Drew Lane&rsquo;s door
was none other than the person known as the
Rat. Drew was surprised to see him. The Rat,
like others of his kind, seldom appeared unless
called. The object he unwrapped before the
young detective&rsquo;s astonished eyes was, he
thought, worth a trip half way round the
world. It was the shoe that had made the
invisible footprint on the sleeping car sheet.
Once Drew&rsquo;s eyes fell upon it, he sat and
stared. A full minute had passed into eternity
before he could say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know dat place beside de river? Down
below de flower shop? Angelo Piccalo&rsquo;s shop?
Dat&rsquo;s de place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew looked at Johnny. Johnny looked at
Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rat,&rdquo; said Drew, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a great old finder.
Here&rsquo;s a fiver. Now scram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rat vanished.</p>
<p>For a long time the detective and his young
friend sat staring at the shoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Drew at last, &ldquo;they say you
can&rsquo;t keep birds from flying over your head,
but you can prevent their building nests in
your hair. Also, &lsquo;Where there is much smoke
there must be some fire.&rsquo; First there&rsquo;s the jimmy
bar, and now there&rsquo;s this shoe. Looks as
if we were beginning to see light. Do you get
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I think I do,&rdquo; replied Johnny, in anything
but a cheerful voice.</p>
<p>Johnny was on his way early next morning.
He crossed the bridge and was about to pass
the flower shop without going in, when Angelo
stepped out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gooda morning, meester Johnny! Dees ees
one&mdash;a fine morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sure, Angelo, it is fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently a box had been opened beside
the flower shop door. The box was gone, but
some broken fragments of wood remained.
Picking up one of these, Angelo began to
whittle absent-mindedly. His actions so fascinated
the boy that he found it hard to talk
coherently. However, he forced himself into
the task of talking about the weather, the river,
speed boats and rare flowers. In the meantime
he watched the keen blade of Angelo&rsquo;s knife
chipping out short, sharp shavings of wood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s nervous. His fingers tremble,&rdquo; he told
himself.</p>
<p>A customer appeared. Angelo went inside.
After a furtive glance, Johnny bent over, seized
a handful of Angelo&rsquo;s shavings, then hurried
away.</p>
<p>A block down the street he paused to drop
the shavings into a used envelope and thrust
them into the side pocket of his coat. &ldquo;Exhibit
A,&rdquo; he murmured as he marched on toward the
office of the News where he was to study
Exchanges. &ldquo;Exhibit A. I wonder!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXII</span>
<br />ON THE &ldquo;SLEEPING LION&rdquo;</h2>
<p>That morning, in the ghostly hour just
before dawn, Red Rodgers and Berley
Todd crept out into the frosty air of Isle Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day,&rdquo; the girl whispered, &ldquo;we are to
play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet, as she stood upon the rocks watching
the waves that, now roaring as they rose,
now whispering as they fell, broke upon those
rugged shores, she seemed to see beneath their
surface grim black hands stretching out to
grasp her.</p>
<p>It was strange, those black waters in the
eerie hour before dawn. Even the staunch
young athlete felt it and was silent.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Once stout oars were in their hands, however,
all was changed. To feel the rise and
fall of the boat, to skim the crests of waves,
to catch the rhythmic rowing that, like a song
in the night, seemed to lift them and bear them
down&mdash;this was life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How she can row!&rdquo; Red told himself, as he
felt the push of her oars send the boat along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the time comes,&rdquo; he said aloud, &ldquo;we
will make it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl replied, &ldquo;but the time is not
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That she spoke the truth Red was soon
enough to know. In the sheltered channel of
Rock Harbor the waves were mere rushing
ripples of foam. But once they came to a gap
between two small islands that looked out into
the open sea, great swells caught their frail
craft and, tossing it back, flecked them with
foam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The voice of many waters.&rdquo; In the girl&rsquo;s
tone there was a touch of awe. &ldquo;In that storm,
on the open lake, no small boat could live. To-morrow
we play.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>Surrendering himself to the will of the elements,
Red Rodgers played. But even as they
sent their boat gliding along to the time of a
song, as they climbed some rocky ledge to
stand breathless looking off at the storm-tossed
waters, or fought their way forward
through masses of tangled vegetation to some
crag where they might find a broader view,
he whispered to himself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am keeping fit. Even this is training for
the day that is to come.&rdquo; And then, as his
mind sobered, he wondered: &ldquo;Will that day
ever come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At noon they built a fire on a tiny beach and
brewed coffee. They ate their lunch in silence.
There was that about this day of storm which
made silence seem a mood to prize.</p>
<p>Just as the sun was sinking in the west, they
turned the prow of their boat into a narrow
opening, then shot her squarely into the teeth
of a storm. Throwing all the force of their
perfect bodies into the business of rowing, they
conquered one gigantic wave, another, another,
and yet another.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>Their boat was but a cork in the midst of
a great ocean, yet they dared accept the wild
waves&rsquo; challenge. Again, again, and yet again,
they fought their way up and over, up and
over until they were twenty boat-lengths out
to sea.</p>
<p>Then, with a laugh that was good to hear,
Red swung the boat about and they went riding
the waves back to shelter and safety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;is life&mdash;life&mdash;life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later they lay upon a bed of
moss at the back of a tiny island known as
&ldquo;Sleeping Lion&rdquo; because of the mane-like crest
of bushes that crowns its ridge, watching the
blue-black waters turn to the silvery gray of
night.</p>
<p>Never had the boy witnessed such a sight.
Starting at the rocks nearest them, the spray
moved along the island shores. And every separate
spray seemed a light that flashed with
one white gleam, then faded into darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Father Superior is lighting his lamps,&rdquo;
the girl whispered. Once again there was awe
in her tone.</p>
<p>So they lingered on the &ldquo;Sleeping Lion&rdquo; until
the afterglow had faded and Father Superior&rsquo;s
lamps were lost in the shades of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>It was the girl who at last broke the silence.
&ldquo;See!&rdquo; She spoke in a voice that was mellow
as the tones of a cello. &ldquo;See! The light that
beckons!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Red looked away across the surging
sea he caught the gleam of a lamp that, winking
and blinking, cast its beams from afar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Passage Island light,&rdquo; he murmured
huskily. &ldquo;The light that shall guide us safely
when the time comes. But to-night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night we dare not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rising as if to break the spell that had been
cast upon her, Berley Todd went whirling
through a wild dance. A weird place for a
dance. Sea gulls, wakened by this sudden
commotion, circled aloft screaming. The very
waves appeared to lapse into silence, a silence
that was to be broken at once by such a mad
onrush as threatened to seize her and drag her
away into waters as black as night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We must go!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Shoving their boat off the rocks, they paddled
silently back to the island shore where,
after concealing their boat, they made their
way cautiously through the spruce trees to
Ed&rsquo;s cabin, and one more steaming bowl of
Mulligan stew.</p>
<p>The day, however, was not over. Wild adventures
awaited them in the night.</p>

<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIII</span>
<br />A VISIT IN THE NIGHT</h2>
<p>As Johnny Thompson returned to Drew
Lane&rsquo;s room in the early evening of that
day, he found himself now in a mood of high
exaltation and now in one of deep depression.
He felt that he had, half by good fortune and
half by earnest endeavor, come close to the
solution of a crime that had filled the front
pages of the nation&rsquo;s press for days. At the
same time he found the accusing hand of Fate
pointing straight at a friend.</p>
<p>To Johnny friendship was a sacred thing.
He worshiped often at the altar of friendship.
To his friends he gave his utmost in loyalty
and devotion. Never until now had he asked
himself the question: &ldquo;What am I to do if
one of these friends proves unworthy of this
loyalty and devotion?&rdquo; There had been no
need. But now&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the matter of the jimmy bar found
in the speed boat,&rdquo; he told himself gloomily.
&ldquo;There is the shoe that made the invisible footprint
on the sheet. There is the wrist-watch
band studded with green stones from Isle Royale.
There is that place down by the river
front from which I was ejected. Ejected!&rdquo;
He chuckled at this. They had put him out
of the place, right enough. But he had done
plenty to them after that, those two bouncers.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;it sure looks bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was relieved to find that both Drew and
Tom were away. Letting himself in by a key
Drew had given him, he dropped into a chair
and for a full half hour sat there alone in the
dark, thinking; and those were long, long
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he sighed, as at last he sat up
in his chair, &ldquo;one&rsquo;s first duty is to his nation
and her laws, to the whole community and not
to one individual who has gone wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>At this he switched on a light and began to
write. When he had finished he placed on
Drew Lane&rsquo;s desk a concise statement of all
that had come under his observation regarding
the kidnaping of the Red Rover. To this he
attached a single newspaper clipping. He had
found this after hours of search in a humble
sheet which bore the name &ldquo;Mining Gazette.&rdquo;
This paper was published in a small city far
up on the North Peninsula of Michigan. The
clipping read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="center">MYSTERIOUS PLANE HEARD OVER ISLE ROYALE</p>
<p><i>Pierre LeBlanc, the head lighthouse keeper on
Passage Island, four miles off Isle Royale, reports
by radio this morning that late in the night he
heard the drum of an airplane motor in the direction
of Isle Royale. It is his belief that the plane
landed in one of the bays or harbors of the island.
Whether it took off later, he was unable to tell.</i></p>
<p><i>Since the only persons on the island are a fisherman
or two and a care-taker at Rock Harbor
Lodge, the reason for this mysterious landing will
not soon be known.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; Johnny wrote after pinning the
clipping to a sheet of paper, &ldquo;this newspaper
was printed the day after the Red Rover&rsquo;s disappearance.
I have stated all the facts as I have
them, and leave you to draw your own conclusions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here also is an envelope containing some
shavings. Have Tom examine them. They
may have been made by the knife he has been
seeking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more. I found the picture of
your friend of the scar and the fiery eye in
the Rogues&rsquo; Gallery. Can&rsquo;t be any mistake.
He is Bat Morgan. His home is in St. Louis.
That is probably why you did not find him
when you really wanted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After scribbling &ldquo;Johnny&rdquo; after this note,
he dropped a paper weight on it, pulled his cap
down over his eyes, caught an elevator and
was soon out in the cool air of night.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>&ldquo;I wonder!&rdquo; There was a look of longing
in Berley&rsquo;s eyes as she stared at Ed&rsquo;s half
burned out fire. &ldquo;Wonder if we dare venture
out into the night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The scout shot her a glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was thinking of our summer home. Do
you have the key?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be fine if Red could see it. I&mdash;I
want him to come back when summer comes.&rdquo;
A dreamy look overspread her face. &ldquo;Good old
summer time,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;with southern
breezes whispering softly, birches gleaming
white in the moonlight and strange birds singing
one another to sleep. Summer time&mdash;&rdquo;
She was singing softly now: &ldquo;Good old summer
time. Will you come and play with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red grinned in spite of himself. Then his
face sobered as he replied huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;if summer ever comes again for
you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not forgotten, would not forget as
long as they were on the island, that they were
escaped victims of kidnapers, that those men
were still about and that he carried in his
pocket the magneto parts that would keep
them from escaping from the island.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>Why did he not cast these bits of metal into
the lake where water is deep? Because he had
hopes, rather wild hopes, but hopes all the
same, that some one would arrive at the island
who could pilot that powerful plane. He could
not. Ed could not, but there were many who
could. So he clung to his hopes and to the
magneto parts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Berley Todd, snuffing out the
candle. &ldquo;Come with me to the place where I
have always found happiness&mdash;my summer
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obeying her command, Ed strapped on one
&ldquo;shootin&rsquo; iron,&rdquo; handed the other to the young
football star, and then led the way out into
the night.</p>
<p>The darkness at this moment was complete.
Later there was to be a moon, a fact long to
be remembered. With the unerring instinct
of a woodsman, the scout led the way over
the winding path. Berley and Red followed
silently.</p>
<p>There were sounds in that night of darkness.
Off to the right the snapping of a twig sounded
like the report of a gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Old Uncle Ned,&rdquo; the girl whispered.</p>
<p>And then, from Ed: &ldquo;Here we are. Now
for the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up a tall flight of stairs they tiptoed. Next
moment they were inside some place that
seemed vast and silent in that darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berley moved about. There were sounds of
shades being drawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A match flared. Shavings on the hearth
blazed up. Soon a great fire on the wide hearth
was burning freely and the place was as light
as day.</p>
<p>They were safe enough for all that. The
massive door was locked and barred. The windows
were high from the ground, and all were
shaded.</p>
<p>Red took the place in with one sweeping
glance. The fireplace was immense. Up from
this ran a wide chimney covered by a curious
rug woven by Indians.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>Before the fire were wide-seated, comfortable
chairs. On the mantel stood a rustic
clock made of birchwood. Berley set this going.
Its cheerful tick-tock, tick-tock filled the
silent place.</p>
<p>As Berley stole a glance at the young football
star she read approval in his eyes, and was
satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes you think of those places you read
about in English history.&rdquo; His smile was good
to see. &ldquo;There should be a whole quarter of
beef roasting over the fire, spears and armor
hanging on the walls, the head of a wild boar
above the mantel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all it&rsquo;s great just as it is. I only
wish we were here under more happy circumstances.&rdquo;
He dropped into the chair farthest
from the blazing fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe enough for the present, at least,&rdquo;
said Ed, lighting his pipe.</p>
<p>Berley Todd sent him a smile of gratitude.
It was evident that for one short evening she
wished to feel safe and quite at home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>Our minds are strange. One moment we
may be in the dark, surrounded, we imagine,
by hostile foes. Our minds are filled with all
sorts of forebodings. The next we are before
a blazing fire in our own home where we have
known peace, and presto! all is changed; fear
goes, peace comes, we know not how.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it.&rdquo; Berley Todd spoke
as one in a dream. &ldquo;When I think of the good
times we have had here, and of the trips we
have planned before this fire! How good it all
was!&rdquo; Her voice trailed off to nothing.</p>
<p>Red saw from the look on her face that she
was thinking: &ldquo;Oh, bury me not on the lone
prairee.&rdquo; He wished she might forget entirely
for one short hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, those other days.&rdquo; There
was an unaccustomed gentleness in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those golden days?&rdquo; Her face brightened.
&ldquo;How we would sit here planning by the fire!
&lsquo;To-morrow we will round the Point in the
little boat and go far back into Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor;
back to Talman&rsquo;s Island. There are wild
raspberries growing round that cabin. And
some great old speckled trout lie in the rocks
nearby.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Talman&rsquo;s Island!&rdquo; Her voice changed. It
was shot through with fear and pain. &ldquo;That
is the island where they were holding us prisoners,
you and I. There&rsquo;s another little island
close by where they stayed themselves in a
tumble-down cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; again the girl changed the subject,
&ldquo;how did they come to get you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took me in my sleep. Rolled me up in my
blankets on the Pullman and shoved me
through the window. I went to sleep waiting
for the train to move up and pick up the rest
of the squad. Carried me down the river in the
speed boat, then over to some place where they
put me on the plane. Then, thunder through
the night, the roar of motors, and there I was
in that cabin, there on the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was all absurdly simple,&rdquo; she sighed.
&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t be rich and happy, it seems, these
days. Perhaps no one should wish to be. I
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; There was a world of questioning
in her tone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our home is large. The grounds that surround
it are broad. I loved to walk there in
the moonlight alone. Had I been the cook or
the maid, I might have walked in peace. But
the daughter&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, two men seized me one night and
carried me away in a car. I kicked out and bit
and tried to scream. It did no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused as if exhausted by the very
thought of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They brought me up here,&rdquo; she began
again, after a time. &ldquo;Just as they did you. I
had been in that little pen of logs a whole
day before they brought you. It&mdash;it was rather
terrible. But by and by it came to me that I
was on Isle Royale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; a faint smile played about
her lips, &ldquo;if I must leave this gloriously beautiful
world, which of course some time I must,
I&rsquo;d sort of like to be on Isle Royale when
that day comes. It wouldn&rsquo;t be so hard, the
parting. And somehow I feel that, after all,
it&rsquo;s just passing from beauty to more beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>For a long time after that there was silence
in the room. Only the ceaseless rush of waters
on the shore, and the friendly tick-tock of the
clock disturbed the stillness of the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They wanted you to sign a paper,&rdquo; Red
suggested after a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kidnapers? Yes, they did. Wanted me
to say I was in great distress. Wanted me to
beg my father to give them money, twenty
thousand dollars, to save my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Her big blue eyes shone with a new
light. &ldquo;Why should I? They are outlaws of
the worst type. If I had done what they wished
I would have been helping them. I have not
much strength. I have a little. If they get my
father&rsquo;s money they will be encouraged, will
go on with their terrible business. They will
take some one far weaker than I, a defenseless
baby, perhaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time one must die.&rdquo; Her eyes were
large and round. &ldquo;Why not now, if need be,
and for a good cause? If they catch me again
and put an end to me, my father will spend
his fortune hunting them down. What finer
tribute could one have to one&rsquo;s memory?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What indeed?&rdquo; Red&rsquo;s eyes shone with true
admiration. &ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll not get you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Berley Todd did not reply. Instead she rose
and began walking slowly back and forth in
the large room. She was humming, and the
words were these: &ldquo;Oh, bury me not on the
lone prairee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the boy with a laugh that came
perilously near being a sob, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time we were
going back.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIV</span>
<br />UNCLE NED DOES HIS BIT</h2>
<p>The moon was out when they took the
trail that led to Ed&rsquo;s cabin. By moving
along single file in the shadows they were
able to keep themselves concealed.</p>
<p>They had covered more than half the distance
to the cabin when of a sudden Berley,
who was in the lead, stopped short to press
her companions back into the deeper shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some&mdash;some one skulking about the
cabin!&rdquo; she whispered tensely.</p>
<p>And there he was. There could be no doubt
about it. The moon, skirting a corner of their
cabin, left there for a space of seconds the
wavering shadow of a man. Ten seconds
passed, and the shadow vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do&mdash;do you think it&rsquo;s the kidnapers?&rdquo; Despite
her bravest efforts the girl could not
prevent her teeth from chattering.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know who it is,&rdquo; the scout grumbled
in a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Only one way to deal
with a skulker. Go after him!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; He turned to Red. &ldquo;In another
moment a cloud will be over the moon. Only a
small cloud. Soon pass. But time enough.
When it gets dark, you go scooting down the
Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor trail. He went that way. Go
down two hundred feet or more, then drop off
into the bush. I&rsquo;ll go round the cabin and
come in from the left. When the moon comes
out I&rsquo;ll flush him some way. After that the
best man wins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;d better stay here,&rdquo; he said to
Berley.</p>
<p>Berley did not stay there. As Red went
skulking down that trail in the dark, she followed.
She was afraid, but being in the darkness
alone with prowlers about, who might
carry her away, was worse than being on the
firing line.</p>
<p>Obeying instructions, Red followed the trail
a hundred paces or less, then dropped away
into the shadows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>Finding a place where the moss grew thick
before a great rock, he drew the girl down beside
him. &ldquo;Really there&rsquo;s no reason to be excited.&rdquo;
He felt her heart&rsquo;s wild beating.
&ldquo;Probably we&rsquo;ll not see him again this night.
He&rsquo;s just scouting around to see who&rsquo;s here.
Not likely to find out much. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s hand pressed hard on his arm.
Off to the left there was a sound of movement.
And then the moon came out.</p>
<p>Instantly from the bush an automatic
barked. The shot had been fired at the scout.
He dropped&mdash;not with a bullet wound, for the
rascal had missed&mdash;but for the purpose of securing
a safe position and waiting his turn.
It had been many years since any one had presumed
to shoot at this scout; years of peace
they had been, and now this, a shot in the
night. His mighty &ldquo;shootin&rsquo; iron&rdquo; roared its
reply.</p>
<p>The thing that happened after that will
never be fully credited by either Red or the
girl, and that in spite of the fact that they saw
it with their own eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>The moon was out in all its glory. From
their observation post before the great rock
they thought they made out a skulking figure
off to the right and not far off the Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor trail. At the same time they caught a
sound of movement still further back in the
bush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more, perhaps three or four of
them.&rdquo; Berley pressed Red&rsquo;s arm hard. &ldquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re
trying to surround us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How wrong she was they were soon enough
to know, for the skulking figure, having come
to rest, lifted his head so far above the thimbleberry
bushes as to leave it in clear view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;&rdquo; Red&rsquo;s voice was a bit unsteady.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of them. Sha-shall I shoot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. That one in the bushes will get
you if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then astonishing things began to happen.
The man on the moonlit trail lifted his gun,
took quick aim and fired, not at the scout, not
at Red, but at the moving spot in the bushes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<p>Instantly from out those bushes came a
charging terror. All legs and head and saber-pointed
antlers, he came straight at the offender
who had fired that last shot. Old Uncle
Ned, veteran bull moose of Isle Royale, had
beyond doubt been nicked by a bullet. Revenge
he would have, and did.</p>
<p>At sight of him the terrified gangster leaped
high in air to clear the bushes. He was caught
squarely by those murderous antlers. Then
moose and man plunged forward into the dark
clump of evergreen growing by the trail.</p>
<p>There came the sound of crashing boards,
followed by the hoarse breathing of some creature
engaged in a life and death struggle.
There were many seconds of this and then,
staggering like a drunken man, Old Uncle
Ned came out to the trail and went slowly
plodding his way into the distant dark.</p>
<p>They waited for the man to appear. A moment
ticked its way into eternity, a second
and a third. From far away came the maniacal
laugh of a loon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; the girl whispered at last, &ldquo;did you
hear that cracking sound?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. What was it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Red, do you know what there is by that
clump of black trees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red, can you guess what has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; Red was very patient. &ldquo;What has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; she drew a long breath, &ldquo;Red, there
is a hole, a very deep hole, ninety feet they say,
at the edge of that clump of black trees. It&rsquo;s
an old mine, almost full of water, green slimy
water. There&mdash;there was a fence around it, a
very poor fence. Old Uncle Ned pushed the
man in there! He&mdash;he fell part way in, Uncle
Ned did, but he came out again. The man did
not come out. He will never come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is that true?&rdquo; Red half rose on one
elbow. &ldquo;Then we must try to save him. He&rsquo;s
bad. But he&rsquo;s a man. Can&rsquo;t let a man die that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red went creeping away in the shadows.
The girl followed. When they reached the
edge of the clump of trees they found the scout
flat on his stomach, flashing a light into the
dark hole that had once been a copper mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone, I guess,&rdquo; he said in a very even tone.
&ldquo;His cap is floating down there. Some bubbles
came up, but he&mdash;he hasn&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red squatted down beside him. The girl
stood looking down. For five minutes, like figures
posed for a piece of statuary, they held
their positions. Then, as he rose stiffly, the
scout said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone, all right enough!&rdquo; Then in a tone
that was like a church bell tolling in the night:
&ldquo;He was bad, probably all through; but for all
that he was a man. It&rsquo;s our duty to ask peace
on his soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment their heads were bowed in
silent prayer. Then, like a squad that has
fired a salute over a comrade&rsquo;s grave, they
right-about-faced and marched solemnly away
into the night.</p>
<p>The scout led the way in silence back to the
cabin. He did not stop there, but marched
straight on. The others, not a little puzzled
at his actions, paused and then followed. Before
a stone slab standing out black in the uncertain
light, he paused.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;marks the grave of an honest
man, a copper miner. No word is inscribed
on that stone, yet the fact that he worked as
a miner marks him as one who at least was
willing to labor for his bread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems a little strange,&rdquo; there was a curious
huskiness in his voice, &ldquo;that more than
fifty years ago this one, whom his comrades
honored with a marked grave, should have labored
to dig that deep hole in the earth that,
never a success as a mine, has now become a
grave for one who deserved little honor. Sort
of seems to prove that no man labors in vain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having delivered this simple sermon, he
turned and led the way back to the cabin.</p>
<p>A few moments later he left once more to
return with a heavy object in his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Take this,&rdquo; he said to Red.</p>
<p>Red reached out for the thing, sank forward,
all but dropped it, then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! How heavy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Native copper,&rdquo; said Ed with a smile.
&ldquo;Taken from the earth when the foundation
for the lodge was laid.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if it had been melted,&rdquo; said Red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably was, before man came upon the
earth. Float copper, they call it. Indians
mined it on Isle Royale many generations before
the white men came. It was a prized possession.
Spear points, arrow points, skinning
knives, knives for fighting could be made
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why are there no mines here now?&rdquo;
Red had visions of becoming a pioneer copper
miner. Next to steel he loved copper best of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was tried more than fifty years ago.
That&rsquo;s what that miner&rsquo;s grave means out
there. Copper mining was tried in many
places. Had it not been for the supposed
wealth of copper deposits here, the United
States would never have owned Isle Royale.
It would have gone to Canada. We bought it
from the Indians. And, after years of labor,
the copper miners discovered that copper mining
on Isle Royale would never pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;it is one great
big beautiful playground, the safe home of wild
life, and will be, I hope, for years to come.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; he said, after a period of silence,
&ldquo;that some time to-morrow the wind will fall.
To-morrow night you may have an opportunity
to tackle the great adventure&mdash;your row
to Passage Island. To-night and to-morrow
you must rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d gladly go with you when the time
comes,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I am large
and heavy. I have a left arm that goes back
on me when I row hard and long. Got a bullet
there once. But you&rsquo;ll make it all right. You&rsquo;ll
make it. Never fear.&rdquo;</p>

<br />THE TRAIL LEADS NORTH</h2>
<p>After leaving Drew Lane&rsquo;s room, Johnny
Thompson had walked the streets for
hours. He needed to think. He could think
best while walking, so he walked.</p>
<p>He had gone back on a man he thought of
as a friend. Or had he? At least, it appeared
that way to him now. Does there ever come a
time when it is one&rsquo;s duty to turn his back
upon a friend? A hard question. He could not
answer it.</p>
<p>Three times he passed the flower shop by
the bridge. The shop was closed, yet a light
cast upon the flowers in the window displayed
Angelo&rsquo;s skill as a florist. He was an artist in
this field. No one could equal him. Could a
man be an artist and yet be a rascal? Angelo
loved music. Often he had talked to Johnny
of symphony concerts, and of grand opera.
Could one love the best in music and yet be
a villain at heart?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>He walked across the bridge and back again.
The place below the shop was completely dark
to-night. No procession of men was passing
down that flight of stairs. Perhaps Angelo had
nothing to do with that which went on below
his shop. Perhaps he knew nothing of it.</p>
<p>Once again his mind took up the problem.
Angelo had always been friendly. His smile
was contagious. Was it true that a man could
&ldquo;smile and smile, and be a villain&rdquo;?</p>
<p>He gave the problem up at last, returned to
his room, and was soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>He was awakened next moment by the jangling
of the telephone. Snatching the receiver,
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning! Johnny Thompson speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; came back an excited voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
Drew! We&rsquo;re on the right trail at last. The
old G.G. was right, has been right all the time.
The trail leads north, five hundred miles, I&rsquo;d
say. Going in the red racer just after noon.
Want to see this thing through with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you mean go&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny was shaking
all over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! Go north with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you know I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right! I&rsquo;ll be over here at twelve. We&rsquo;ll
have a bite of chow; shoot over to the aviation
field, and be on our way.&rdquo; The receiver
clicked. He was gone.</p>
<p>Johnny sat down on his bed. He was dizzy.
&ldquo;The trail leads north,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He
didn&rsquo;t say: &lsquo;Johnny, you&rsquo;re a brick!&rsquo; or any of
that sort of stuff, or &lsquo;You put us right.&rsquo; Nothing
like that. Just &lsquo;The trail leads north.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he thought more soberly, &ldquo;perhaps
I&rsquo;m not a brick. Perhaps I didn&rsquo;t put them
right. Perhaps I&rsquo;m a hundred per cent dumb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sat there alone he realized that he
hoped with all his heart that he had been entirely
wrong. &ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and
yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;A cup of coffee,
a piece of pie and you.&rsquo; To-morrow&rsquo;s another
day. To-morrow we shall probably know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But five hundred miles due north!&rdquo; His
mind sobered. &ldquo;Just Drew Lane and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew&rsquo;s developed into a swell pilot. He&rsquo;ll
take us there O.K. But after that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had been through some tight places with
Drew Lane, as you will know if you have read
<i>The Arrow of Fire</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tight places,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Looks like
this might be tighter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as I said before, &lsquo;A cup of coffee, a
piece of pie and you.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>As Johnny Thompson and Drew Lane sped
northward in the red racer that afternoon,
Johnny found plenty of time for thought. Sober
thoughts were his. At the airport Drew
had said never a word regarding their coming
adventure, nor the facts that had led him to
take this wild dash into the north.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<p>Like a mill set to grind out products by
electrical power, the boy&rsquo;s mind went over the
facts that lay before him. As he closed his
eyes he could see a rusty jimmy bar lying in
the back of young Angelo&rsquo;s boat. He could
feel the weight of it as he carried it home and
he experienced again his sharp surprise as Tom
Howe discovered that this was the very bar
that had pried open Red&rsquo;s car window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that proved nothing,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;Any one could have hidden the bar in that
speed boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is the invisible footprint.&rdquo; His
mind was off again. He saw the footprint appearing
under the eerie purple light, saw it
fade, then appear again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the shoe that made that footprint on
the Red Rover&rsquo;s sheet was found close to the
door beneath Angelo&rsquo;s flower shop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <i>that</i> proves nothing.&rdquo; He said the
words aloud to the thundering motors. &ldquo;Any
one can drop a pair of shoes by your door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He saw again the figures in
that room of mystery beneath Angelo&rsquo;s shop.
Who were those men? Why were they there?
Why were so many of them wearing black
looks? And why had they attempted to throw
him out?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;it all depends
upon the last bit of evidence I turned in, the
shavings made by Angelo&rsquo;s pocket knife. If
Tom Howe can show that the shavings found
near the Red Rover&rsquo;s car were made by that
same knife, then I shall be convinced. And
once one is convinced that a supposed friend
is a law-breaker there is but one thing he can
do: see that he is brought to justice. No enemy
of my country can continue to claim me as a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what had Tom and Drew found out?
This remained to be seen.</p>
<p>Suddenly his attention was caught by Drew
Lane. Drew was leaning far over, looking at
something. There was a worried look on his
face. But at last he settled back in his place.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>Again Johnny saw in his mind&rsquo;s eye the
picture of that glassy-eyed one with the scar.
Then a thought struck him all of a heap. &ldquo;Suppose
we are going after that man and his pals.
Suppose they are all there, the glassy-eyed one,
the big man like a baboon and his son, the
three all alike, and the others!&rdquo; A thrill
coursed up and down his spine. A not entirely
comfortable feeling took possession of him.
They were but two, he and Drew. There was
a small black bag at Drew&rsquo;s feet. It was full
of blue-black weapons and ammunition. He
knew that. &ldquo;But two&mdash;just two of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dismissed the thought. Drew was game,
game to the last drop. But he was no fool.</p>
<p>Once again Johnny closed his eyes. This
time it was a different sort of person who
walked across the walls of his memory; a tall
man with smiling eyes; very tall and very thin;
Jimmie Drury, the reporter from the News.</p>
<p>He had gone to Jimmie to obtain permission
to go through the exchange files, and then a
curious thing had happened. It puzzled him
still. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d he know?&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;How
<i>could</i> he? And yet, he seemed terribly sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie had been very cordial. &ldquo;A fellow
that&rsquo;s Drew Lane&rsquo;s friend is welcome here any
time.&rdquo; He had smiled a broad smile. &ldquo;What
are you looking up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to do with the kidnaping of the Red
Rover,&rdquo; Johnny explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Red Rover!&rdquo; Jimmie whistled. &ldquo;What
do you know about that case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several things.&rdquo; Johnny had been on his
guard. &ldquo;Got a lot of disconnected facts. Why
don&rsquo;t you get in touch with Drew Lane and
find out about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in touch with Drew.&rdquo; A curious look
came over Jimmie&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;Closer than even
he may&mdash;&rdquo; He had checked himself as if he
had said too much.</p>
<p>Johnny looked at him and then a curious
suspicion had popped into his mind. Jimmie
was long and slim, little more than a skeleton
in blue serge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a skeleton. A&mdash;&rdquo; He had nearly
thought another word, but not quite.</p>
<p>What he had said to Jimmie was: &ldquo;Drew
doubts the Galloping Ghost; thinks he&rsquo;s trying
to get him off on the wrong trail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then again a strange look had flashed across
the reporter&rsquo;s face as he exclaimed in a tone
suggesting anger: &ldquo;You tell Drew he&rsquo;d better
stick by the Galloping Ghost. He&rsquo;s giving him
straight dope!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How could he know that?&rdquo; Johnny asked
himself now as he looked down once more at
the masses of black, white and dull green that
were fields, lakes and forests far below.</p>
<p>There was little enough time to study this
problem, for suddenly Drew headed the red
racer downward at a rakish slant.</p>
<p>Down, down, down they went. Once the
motor was off for a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the place?&rdquo; Johnny demanded
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it. Something wrong.&rdquo; Drew
spoke rapidly. &ldquo;Got to go down and see what.
Land on the little lake yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the motor roared. As the plane
circled downward Johnny&rsquo;s hopes fell. &ldquo;Something
wrong! We&rsquo;ll be here perhaps for hours.
And get there too late. What rotten luck!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVI</span>
<br />BATTLE OVER THE WAVES</h2>
<p>There were hours of rest for the Red
Rover and his staunch little companion, a
lulling of the wild storm that for many hours
had lashed the rocky shores of Isle Royale.
Then came darkness and with it a swift resolve
to risk all on a night of pure adventure.</p>
<p>A hearty handshake with the guide who had
stood by them so staunchly, and they were
away.</p>
<p>Slowly the tiny craft crept out upon the
black waters of night. They had dressed for
the occasion, this girl and boy. He wore a
suit of khaki borrowed from the scout, she a
boy&rsquo;s shirt found in one of the cabins, and the
patched knickers. Dressed so, and riding in
their dark green boat, only with difficulty
would they be seen upon the dark waters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>There were reasons for this precaution, the
scout had assured them. Having guessed their
plan, the kidnapers might even now be lurking
in the shadow of some cove, ready to pounce
upon them. For this Red was not unprepared.
One of the &ldquo;shootin&rsquo; irons&rdquo; hung at his belt.</p>
<p>Keeping close to shore, they passed great
jagged piles of rock that loomed large in the
night. They crossed &ldquo;Nebraska Bay,&rdquo; skirted
more rocks, then, following the scout&rsquo;s advice,
cut boldly away toward the rocky shoals
which, because of the darkness, could not be
seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; The boy rested on his oars. There
came no sound save the sound of heavy swells
breaking lazily over distant rocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be some roll out there,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>Then over the waters there moved a breath
of air that, beginning with a whisper, ended
with a sigh as it passed on into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How weird it seems out here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spooky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To break the spell, they took up the oars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>And now, as on that other occasion, they
dropped into the steady rhythmic swing that
would carry them far and tire them not at all.</p>
<p>They did not sing, nor whistle, nor even
hum. That would not be safe. For all that,
their spirits blended as one as they swept along
to the dreamy swing of &ldquo;Blue Danube,&rdquo; &ldquo;Indian
Love Song&rdquo; and &ldquo;Where the River Shannon
Flows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the steel mill and on the gridiron the
young football star had known team work,
but never such as this. Forgotten were the
perils that lurked in the night; forgotten the
danger of darkness and possible storm. For
the moment here was life, life as he had never
before known it. What else could matter?</p>
<p>So, with the moon just showing over the
rocky crest of Isle Royale, they swept across
the narrow channel, then took up a course that
in time would lead them out into the wide open
sea.</p>
<p>The girl too had caught the spell of the
night. As they stole into the shadow of a
great rock towering up from the depths, she
shuddered, but rowed steadily on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A real little brick!&rdquo; Red thought to himself.
&ldquo;Nothing soft.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resolved that, should they make it, she
certainly must be on the side lines in that
greatest of all games that was to come.</p>
<p>The rocks they passed grew lower and lower.
The shoal was breaking up here. Soon
they would leave it all behind. And then, with
only that winking, blinking light to guide
them, they would face the swells and go gliding
over them to&mdash;. Red&rsquo;s thoughts broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he heard something, the low groan of
an oarlock, the mumble of a voice? Who could
say? It did not come again.</p>
<p>Swinging the boat about, he headed it
straight for the Passage Island light that,
gleaming a good four miles away, seemed to
send them an encouraging wink.</p>
<p>With a rush of glee a great swell seized
them and lifted them lightly. But, like some
good-natured giant, it let them down gently to
go on their way with a whispering swish of
foam.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>And now, forgetting their songs, they put
their shoulders to the task before them. Meeting
the swells at an angle to avoid the dash
of chilling waters, they rose on the crest of a
high one to drop into the trough, then swept
across a half score of low crests, to be again
lifted on high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time it was the girl whose instinct told
her to rest on her oars. Once again there
passed over the waters that whisper that ended
in a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as if voices of the Unseen were trying
to tell us something, perhaps to warn us.&rdquo; Her
voice was low. &ldquo;Do you believe in the Unseen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; It was weird, this whisper
in the night.</p>
<p>Once again they took up their oars. Not
long had they to wait ere they saw that which
was creeping upon them in the night. The
moon had long been under a cloud. Now it
sent its beams across every sweeping swell.
And upon one of these swells rode a boat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A rowboat,&rdquo; Red grumbled low. &ldquo;A boat and two men.
Now it is life
or death. They are armed. They will not hesitate to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Realizing the truth of his words, the girl thrilled to the very
center of her being.</p>
<p>There was need for no explaining. The scout had been right; these
men had been watching. They had, perhaps, watched from the wrong
point. This had given the boy and girl a start. But now here they
were, some hundreds of yards behind, two men against a boy and a
girl, and half the distance yet to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s hiss answered the hiss
of a wave that rolled by. &ldquo;Now we must show them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They did show them. They rowed with unity of motion and with all
the force God had given them; rowed until even in the chill of
night their faces ran with perspiration and their arms became
bars of aching fire.</p>
<p>And yet, it was not enough. Those others were rowing with the
desperation of those who hear the clanging of a prison gate
behind them. Beyond a doubt they knew prison life.
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
Theirs was the frenzy of those whose souls are stirred to the
depths by great fear. They knew fear. This was their only
emotion. Love, pity, compassion, these they did not know.
So they worked with the frenzy of despair.</p>
<p>And they gained now a boat&rsquo;s length, now another, another and yet
another. Each wave crest that lifted them high found them closer
to their prey.</p>
<p>They would have won but for one man&rsquo;s over-reaching hate and the
hosts of &ldquo;Invisible Ones&rdquo; that the girl believed
peopled the heavens.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, weary with rowing, overcome by his burning hate,
the man nearest the prow threw down his oars. The next instant
a shot rang out and a bullet sang across the waters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie down in the boat!&rdquo; was Red&rsquo;s
command to Berley.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, but obeyed.</p>
<p>On the crest of the wave the boy bent low. Once
again a bullet sang close at hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>In the trough he rowed desperately. Swinging his
boat half about, he avoided, as long as
he could, rising on the next crest. When at last
he did rise, he dropped flat beside his companion.</p>
<p>Just in time. A bullet crashing into the boat
passed over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two can play at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red crept forward, placed his &ldquo;shootin&rsquo;
iron&rdquo; across the stern, waited his time, then
loosed a roar like the burst of a cannon.</p>
<p>The answer came singing over&mdash;too high.</p>
<p>Then, as if provoked by the unfairness of the
battle, the &ldquo;Unseen&rdquo; took a hand. Sudden
darkness settled upon the water. A cloud as
black as ink came sweeping in from the north.
A voice from the air, not a whisper, but a
roar, told them that one of those sudden storms
that sweep across Lake Superior in November
was at hand.</p>
<p>The girl was up and in her place on the
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now may God have mercy on our
souls!&rdquo; she murmured, as Red seized his oars
and they began to row.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>Who can describe the fury of such a storm,
the rushing of wind, waves mounting higher
and higher, foam hissing to the right and left
of you, darkness all about you, even the gleam
of the light from Passage Island lost for long,
desperate moments?</p>
<p>And yet you battle as never before. Heading
your boat squarely into the teeth of the
storm, you rise and fall, rise and fall like a
cork in the center of the Atlantic. You battle.
You pray. You hope until hope seems vain.</p>
<p>And then, just as all seems over, the storm
passes with one long, whispering sigh.</p>
<p>As the moon came out and the rush of wind
passed, the boy and girl looked upon a world
of steel-blue waves flecked with foam. And on
those waves some distance away there rode a
boat. It was a white boat with an orange-colored
bottom. A great deal of orange was
showing; very little white. The boat was upside
down.</p>
<p>Once again, as they looked, Red said hoarsely:
&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As before, there came the long whisper that
ended with a sigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>But even as they rested on their oars there
came to their listening ears a louder sound,
the drumming of an airplane&rsquo;s motor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are coming!&rdquo; Red took up his oars.
&ldquo;Passage Island is just over there. It can&rsquo;t be
far now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXVII</span>
<br />A HAUNTED BAY</h2>
<p>As you have guessed, the plane heard by the
Red Rover and Berley Todd was Drew
Lane&rsquo;s red racer. And Johnny Thompson was
riding in the rear cockpit.</p>
<p>Drew had planned his trip well. They should
have reached the island before dark. But misfortune
had befallen them. Forced down by a
leaky fuel pipe, they had found themselves on
the surface of a small lake in the midst of a
great forest where there was no one. After
two hours of labor with a few tools and scant
material, they had managed to repair the leak.
This delay had forced them to fly in the night,
and here they were approaching an island
known to them only by reports and by a map
that lay spread out before Drew in the cockpit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>Despite his meager knowledge, he did wonderfully
well. Having arrived at the east end
of the island, he flew directly across it. Catching
the gleams of light that came from three
narrow bands of water, he knew them to be
Rock Harbor, Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor and Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay. Choosing the middle one of these, he
dropped low to go scooting along less than
two hundred feet in air.</p>
<p>As he flew, the gleam of a powerful searchlight,
attached to the plane, played upon the
water.</p>
<p>Of a sudden that light shot upward, then
blinked out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found what he was looking for,&rdquo; Johnny
Thompson told himself. &ldquo;But what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question he could form no certain
answer; perhaps a boat, a cabin or an airplane.
In fact, Johnny was almost completely in the
dark regarding the purpose and probable outcome
of this, the latest of Drew Lane&rsquo;s adventures.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>When he had met the young detective he had
said never a word. In silence they had climbed
into the plane and flown away. Who had kidnaped
the Red Rover and Berley Todd?
Johnny did not know. Did Drew Lane know?
Were the kidnapers on this island? Was the
Red Rover? Was Berley Todd? The boy did
not know. All he knew was that he appeared
to be right bang up against one more exciting
adventure, and that was enough.</p>
<p>Tipping the plane at a rakish angle, Drew
Lane sent it over a narrow ridge of land to
drop at last upon a narrow stretch of black
water. This was Rock Harbor. The scout&rsquo;s
cabin was not half a mile away. Hearing the
drum of a motor, he extinguished his light,
then sprang to the door just in time to see
the plane land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;More kidnapers, officers
of the law, or just ordinary folks. I expected
to have a dull time at this place, all by
myself, but blamed if it ain&rsquo;t been exciting so
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he buckled his one remaining &ldquo;shootin&rsquo;
iron&rdquo; about his waist and disappeared into
the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>At that same hour a second plane, all silver
and white, circled over a stretch of water
black as night, then, graceful as a sea gull,
sank to rest.</p>
<p>The body of water was Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. Two
miles long, one quarter as wide, with trees
growing to the very edge of its lapping waters
and never so much as an abandoned shack
standing beside it, this bay at all seasons of
the year is a dark and lonesome spot as night
falls across the world.</p>
<p>Night was here. So too were the chill winds
of November. But the single occupant of the
plane appeared to give little heed to all this.
Unfolding a curious sort of collapsible rubber
boat, he filled it with air, took a short paddle
from his fusilage, stepped into the rubber affair
and paddled ashore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>The spot upon which he landed had perhaps
at one time been a barren stretch of sand.
Overgrown now with tangled grass and low
bushes, it forms a perfect camping ground.
Such it has been for countless generations.
From this spot ten thousand camp fires have
sent their golden gleams across the black waters
of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay. Each in turn has faded into
the darkness of night. Had this strange visitor,
a slender person in a long black coat, cared for
such things, he might have dug beneath his
very feet and found there charcoal and half
burned bones from fires that had gleamed a
hundred, perhaps two hundred years ago. For,
since Isle Royale lifted its rocky head from
out the deep and took on a cap of green, this
spot has been the camping place of man.</p>
<p>The stranger did not dig. He stood there
long as if in silent contemplation.</p>
<p>He might have fished, for in these very
waters such great northern pikes (wolves of
all fresh water seas) as are not found elsewhere
play among the wavering weeds. Had he cared
to wait for dawn, then had he put out across
the narrow bay to set a silver spoon gleaming
through the black waters, he might have experienced
such a thrill as is seldom accorded
a fisherman.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<p>He did not wait for dawn. Instead, by the
gleam of a small flashlight he studied a slip
of paper for a moment; then turning abruptly
about, lost himself in the dense brush that lines
the slope of a high ridge just back of this narrow
clearing.</p>
<p>Duncan&rsquo;s Bay is separated from Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor&mdash;which, as you will recall, was the
landing place of first the kidnapers&rsquo; plane and
after that Drew Lane&rsquo;s red racer&mdash;by a tall
and narrow ridge of rocks heavily overgrown
with brush.</p>
<p>A half hour after this tall person from the
silver plane vanished from the camping
grounds of Duncan&rsquo;s Bay, a strange apparition
might have been seen at the very crest
of the ridge.</p>
<p>At this spot, known as Lookout Louise, one
may stand at a point some hundreds of feet
above the water level and look down upon the
dark and somber bay that lies below. On this
particular night, viewed from this height, the
silver plane seemed a giant sea gull with wings
outspread.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>But the apparition&mdash;he wore a long flowing
robe of filmy white. As the moon came out to
gleam upon him, his head appeared as white
as his robe. And his body was bones, just
gleaming white bones, or so it would have
seemed had some one been there to look.
There was no one.</p>
<p>For one full moment he stood gazing down
at the black waters and the silver plane. Then,
turning slowly about, he gave utterance to a
low, hollow chuckle as weird as the song of
the wind in the pines of a churchyard at midnight.
Then, like the phantom he seemed, he
dropped away into the shadows that lay above
Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor where at that very moment
the fate of Drew Lane, Johnny Thompson and
the kidnapers swung uncertainly in the balance.
And even as this strange apparition vanished,
he appeared to gallop.</p>

<br />THE LIGHT THAT FAILED</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Red! Red! The light is gone!&rdquo; Berley
Todd&rsquo;s voice rang with tragedy.</p>
<p>She had endured much that night, had this
little daughter of the rich. She had rowed
until she felt herself near to exhaustion when
of a sudden she had discovered that they were
pursued. Getting her second wind, she had
rowed as she had never dreamed any one could
row. She had dodged bullets and battled a
storm. Now the light from Passage Island
that had guided them all the way had failed.
It was too much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red! The light is gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhere in the dark, waves were dashing
against rocks. The roar of it filled her ears.
Still their boat, tossed about, moved forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must row.&rdquo; Three words escaped
Red&rsquo;s tight set lips; no more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>The roar of waters sounded louder. The
boy changed their course. They glided from
danger. Now and then the girl caught the
gleam of a white-cap when with the hiss of a
sea serpent it broke close beside them.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden the boy put all the strength
of his splendid arms into a dozen titanic
strokes. They rose to the crest of a wave;
another, yet another and then as if by magic
they glided out upon a sea of glass.</p>
<p>The girl caught her breath. What was it?
Had she fallen asleep? Was she dreaming?</p>
<p>No, no. As if by pre-arrangement, the moon
came out to shine upon a scene of matchless
beauty. A harbor, walled in on every side by
steep, rocky cliffs, lay about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Red Rodgers, with a touch of
the dramatic in his voice, &ldquo;is the harbor on
Passage Island. We are safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sinking down to a place in the prow, the
girl allowed her head to drop into her hands
while she strove in vain to drive from her
senses the ceaseless roar of the beating surf.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>After a time she lifted her head to admit
into her consciousness certain vital facts. Her
feet were ankle deep in water, and had been
for an hour; yet she had not known it. Her
hands were blistered. Her arms ached. Red
had found a flashlight and had switched it on.
They were nearing a shore. On the shore was
a narrow dock and a boathouse. All this came
to her as if she were a very small child reading
it from a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This harbor,&rdquo; Red spoke at last, &ldquo;is about a
mile from the lighthouse. There is no safe
landing there for such a night. The light is
not out. We were passing along close to a
rocky wall that hid the light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a trail from this place to the lighthouse.
And at the lighthouse there is a fire
and blankets, food and good cheer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Food and good cheer,&rdquo; the girl repeated
after him as in a dream. &ldquo;Then we will go
there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>They did go there, though the girl will not
recall the long stretch of pasture-like land
over which they passed, nor the ridge they
scaled to descend on the other side and to
catch again the blinking rays of that cheering
light. She will not recall all this because she
walked as one in a dream.</p>
<p>At the lighthouse, besides two men, there
was a woman, the head keeper&rsquo;s sister. To her
care Berley Todd was entrusted. When she
had wrapped her in hot blankets and poured
steaming broth down her throat, she bundled
her off to bed where for long hours Berley
dreamed of kidnapers, wild waves and cracking
guns.</p>
<p>The Red Rover did not sleep. Never more
awake in his life, he found himself in a position
to act; and the Red Rover was born for action
alone. For days his immediate future, the
possibility of getting back to Old Midway in
the great game, his very life itself, had hung
in the balance. Now the balance had swung
down. Fate had given him a break.</p>
<p>As he stood outside the lighthouse, his mind
still in a whirl, a short chubby man with a
beaming sort of smile approached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Pierre Gagnon. And you,&rdquo; he beamed
afresh, &ldquo;are the great Red Rover.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call me,&rdquo; Red said quietly.
&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Only one thing
truly matters. How am I to get back to the
city in time for that game?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see&mdash;&rdquo; He was growing eager now;
all the dull feeling of weariness had left him.
He yearned for battle. &ldquo;You see, a lot depends
on that game. Not&mdash;not for me, but for others.
There&rsquo;s the school, great Old Midway! It gave
me a chance. Took me out of the steel mill and
taught me the things I needed most to know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the Grand Old Man, our
coach. The cleanest sportsman the world has
ever known. And this is his last year, his last
game. That game must be won!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the public, too. They&rsquo;re hoping
against hope. They suppose that I&rsquo;ll be there.
They bought tickets to help out a great cause.
They should get a show for their money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he smiled grimly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s up to
us, just you and me. To-morrow at two p. m.
the team lines up. Seventy thousand people
will be crying for victory. You should see it,
Pierre, you really should! It&rsquo;s inspiring!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll go in an airplane,&rdquo; said Pierre. &ldquo;You
must. There can be no other way. We have
here a radio telephone. We can speak with
Detroit, Chicago, any big city of the midwest.
To-day there are airplanes everywhere. It will
be easy. Come! We will send out the call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The call. Wait!&rdquo; Once again the boy&rsquo;s
mind was in a whirl. &ldquo;The call.&rdquo; It would be
heard everywhere. Men would rush to newspaper
offices to sell the story. &ldquo;<i>The Red Rover
found!</i>&rdquo; would be flashed across the country.
The radio, the press, and after that every man,
woman and child would take up the cry: &ldquo;<i>The
Red Rover has been found!</i>&rdquo; He thrilled at the
thought, thrilled to the very center of his being.
But did he want this? A voice deep within
his very soul whispered: &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; His hand was on the arm of the
genial lighthouse keeper. &ldquo;Wait for a time, at
least.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>He recalled the sound of drumming motors
that had struck his ears out there while he and
the girl still tossed upon the waters. &ldquo;There
may be some other way,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;No
brass bands for me. If only I can slip back to
the city unheralded; if I could take my place
behind the line when the great moment comes;
if only I could do that without even the Grand
Old Man knowing! Oh, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again he murmured, &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXIX</span>
<br />SILENT NIGHT</h2>
<p>It would seem that Red Rodgers&rsquo; reasons
for wishing to rejoin his team were all that
one might ask; yet at the very moment he
stood there talking with the chubby lighthouse
keeper, Drew Lane was telling Johnny Thompson
of reasons that to him seemed tremendously
important. These reasons had to do with
the cause of the kidnaping. Who would not
find this a subject of absorbing interest?</p>
<p>Drew Lane possessed an all but superhuman
power of finding his way about in the dark.
Though he had never before seen Isle Royale,
he not only was able to land safely in the channel
known as Rock Harbor, but once ashore,
he experienced little difficulty in making his
way across the ridge to the other channel that
lay on the opposite side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said to Johnny as they at last
came out upon a short boat landing, &ldquo;is Tobin&rsquo;s
Harbor. At the back of this harbor the
powerful amphibian that carried the Red Rover
to Isle Royale lies at anchor. Thus far we
are in luck. If the Red Rover is still in their
midst we shall be in greater luck. And if we
succeed in rescuing him without having our
much treasured heads blown off, ours will be
the greatest luck in all the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whose plane is that amphibian?&rdquo; Johnny
could no longer suppress a question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to know.&rdquo; Drew Lane&rsquo;s
tone was serious. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s quite a story. We have
some distance to go. Here&rsquo;s a boat beside the
landing. Probably chained up, but we&rsquo;ll break
her loose. Suppose we get her off? Then you
can row while I talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K. Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The padlock that held the boat was a cheap
one. Two knocks with a rock opened it as
though it were a clam shell.</p>
<p>Ed, the scout, crouching with his dog at
the top of the ridge, heard those blows, but
wisdom counseled no interference.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>Only when the boat was gone did he descend
the hill. After skirting the shore for a
short distance, he proceeded to drag a light
canoe from the center of a clump of bushes
where it stood on end, safely concealed. In
this, by cutting off at an angle, he was able
to keep Drew Lane and Johnny Thompson
within striking distance without himself being
observed. Did he mean to strike? Perhaps
he could not have answered this question himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious business.&rdquo; Drew spoke in low
tones, as Johnny with long, strong strokes
drove the light rowboat along. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t
been in on it perhaps we would have gotten
nowhere. You had all the luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; Johnny lost a stroke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luck no end!&rdquo; Drew rumbled. &ldquo;Remember
the jimmy bar? The invisible footprint? The
shavings? Sure you do. They were red hot
clues that led us straight to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then&mdash;then it was Angelo, the&mdash;the flower
shop keeper?&rdquo; Johnny lost two strokes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Angelo.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<p>For a time after that there was silence. This
silence was broken by Johnny. His voice was
husky. &ldquo;I only feel bad for the boy, young
Angelo. He is a fine young chap. And he has
had everything&mdash;big car, speed boat&mdash;going
to college. Everything. And now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now his father is going to be broke. We
are here to arrange all that. We must not fail.
To-night Angelo Piccalo is rich. He believes
he is safe, that his riches are safe. To-morrow
night at this hour, if our plans work out, he
will be broke, broke and in prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too many times&mdash;&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s voice was tense
with pent-up emotion. &ldquo;Too many times we
go out and get a rich crook and he is able to
buy his freedom, by corrupting a judge or a
jury with the very money he stole from honest
men. This time there shall be no chance for
this; not a chance. We&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; His voice suddenly fell to a hoarse
whisper. &ldquo;Look! Over yonder is the light of
a camp fire. Must be their camp, the kidnapers&rsquo;
camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Drew bent over, then straightened
up to thrust a thing of cold steel into Johnny&rsquo;s
hand. &ldquo;Put this in your pocket. And this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use &rsquo;em unless you have to.&rdquo; The
young detective&rsquo;s tone was low and tense.
&ldquo;But if you have to, shoot often and straight.
It&rsquo;s a tough bunch. Don&rsquo;t know how many,
but plenty, I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As for the boy, Angelo,&rdquo; his tone changed,
&ldquo;don&rsquo;t worry too much about him. He&rsquo;ll have
to get along without his car and speed boat
all right. But then there are plenty of people
who&rsquo;ll tell you big cars and speed boats do a
boy more harm than good. Gives them false
notions of life; that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;d tell you. I
don&rsquo;t know much about that. An old police
flivver with, like as not, a share of bullets waiting
at the end of the road&mdash;that&rsquo;s as far as I
ever got.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one thing I <i>do</i> know.&rdquo; He sat up
straight and stiff. &ldquo;Crooked dollars never did
any one any real good. And every dollar Angelo
Piccalo spent on that boy was crooked.
Flowers! That flower shop was only a blind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; Johnny mused, pulling
hard at the oars. &ldquo;Angelo is an artist at heart.
He can make flowers talk. He loves music, and
the best in pictures. Why should such a man
be a crook?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man&rsquo;s love of honesty has&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Johnny! Swing a little more to the
left. We&rsquo;ll keep well out. Then when we&rsquo;ve
passed their camp we&rsquo;ll swing in. They&rsquo;re in
a sort of clearing. Trees beyond them. Plenty
of chance to slip up. They&rsquo;ll not see us out
here on the water. The moon is low yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again for a time there was silence, such
silence as one finds only on a calm bay of Isle
Royale at night. Now came from afar the
sharp yip-yip-yip of a bush wolf. And now,
from the opposite shore of the bay they caught
the faint plash-plash of a moose swimming
along the shore. Or was it a boat? Johnny&rsquo;s
heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see us. Works both ways. We can&rsquo;t
see them. Might slip up on us. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This artist business,&rdquo; Drew broke in with
a hoarse whisper. &ldquo;Curious thing. A man can
be a fine musician or a painter, and still be
a crook. They&rsquo;ve got some fine artists in Sing
Sing. Art and conscience have no connection,
it seems. The only thing that saves a fellow
from being a crook is a desire deep down in
his heart to be honest, to do right by all men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew lapsed into silence. There were many
things Johnny wished to know. How was it
that Drew felt so sure he was on the right
track? What fresh evidence had he uncovered?
How much had his own discoveries
helped to bring things about? But this, he
knew, was no time for questions. They were
nearing a camp. Was it the enemies&rsquo; camp?
Who could doubt it? The big amphibian could
not be a quarter of a mile from that camp.</p>
<p>So in that silence, broken only by the cries
of wild things in the night, he rowed on.</p>
<p>And after them, in utter silence, there came
a canoe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXX</span>
<br />HOLLOW CHUCKLES</h2>
<p>On a moose trail that leads down the steep
slope of the ridge lying between Duncan&rsquo;s
Bay and Tobin&rsquo;s Harbor a flashlight
gleamed. Once, twice, and yet again Johnny
Thompson saw that light flashing among the
trees high up and far away, and he wondered
a long wonder. He said nothing to Drew Lane.
The time had come for silence and action.
Bending low, he drove their boat forward at
increased speed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the light on the slope blinked
on and off, was lost among the shadows of tall
spruce trees, came out into the open, vanished
behind overhanging rocks, then was lost to
view altogether as it reached lower levels
where giant spruce trees, a primeval forest,
cast deep shadows over a small world as dark
as a tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That light,&rdquo; Johnny told himself, &ldquo;is no
witch light of the night. Some one is coming
down the ridge. Wonder who? And why?
Drew said this island was practically uninhabited
in winter. Looks as if the ghost of
every Indian, explorer or trader who ever visited
these shores has returned to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts,&rdquo; he whispered to himself, &ldquo;surely
are queer!&rdquo; He was thinking of the Galloping
Ghost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll swing in.&rdquo; It was Drew who
broke this curious chain of thoughts.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes more of silent rowing and
their boat touched without a sound on a mossy
shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; Drew breathed. &ldquo;Bushes here. We
can hide the boat. May need it in case&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish, but Johnny caught the
meaning&mdash;in case the men they were after
were too strong for them. He had visions of
Drew stumbling through the brush carrying
his bullet-riddled body. It was not a pleasing
vision. He put it out of his mind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>And indeed there was need of this. There
was little or no trail on this side of the channel.
Here a moose had crowded his way
through the brush; and here, becoming discouraged,
he had left the next comer to make
the best of things and had taken to the water.</p>
<p>There was need for extreme caution. The
snapping of a twig, the sudden rush of a moose
disturbed in the night, would betray their
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About half the way,&rdquo; Drew breathed at
last.</p>
<p>A stretch of barren, sloping rocks greeted
their eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skirt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crept across in the shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be nearly there. Get ready.&rdquo; Drew
was calm. Though little more than a boy, he
was a seasoned trooper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There&rsquo;s a gleam of light!&rdquo; Johnny
gripped his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just around this next clump of pines we&rsquo;ll
get a clear view. And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were around those pines before Johnny
in his suspense breathed twice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now! You ready?&rdquo; Drew squared his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then, you fellows!&rdquo; His voice sounded
out strangely in the night. &ldquo;We got you
covered. Reach for the stars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sound of sudden commotion by
the camp fire. Three figures leaped into view.
But they were not &ldquo;reaching for the stars.&rdquo;
Their hands hung awkwardly at their sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what&mdash;&rdquo; Drew all but dropped his
gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the bunch we&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; he said
in a low tone aside to Johnny. &ldquo;Got to keep
&rsquo;em comin&rsquo; though. Got guns. May shoot us
without knowing what it&rsquo;s all about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you are!&rdquo; he commanded sharply. &ldquo;One
move, and out goes your light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men did not move. Instead, as Drew
approached them slowly, they stood blinking
into his flashlight.</p>
<p>Drew took in the scene at a glance. The
camp had been made on a shelving rock. A
little back from the fire lay the hind quarters
of a moose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Great luck!&rdquo; he thought to himself.
&ldquo;Poachers. Not allowed to kill moose on this
island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest, mister,&rdquo; it was a grown boy who
spoke at last, &ldquo;we only kill what we got to
have to eat. We can&rsquo;t starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya, we do,&rdquo; put in a heavy-set man with
ham-like hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-l-l&mdash;&rdquo; Drew was thinking fast. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
an officer of the law. I could take you all right.
But I&rsquo;m after bigger game. There are kidnapers
on this island. Know that?&rdquo; He turned
to the boy of the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&mdash; There&rsquo;s some queer ones back
there at Baley&rsquo;s cabin. We seen &rsquo;em. Sort of
black. But not niggers, I don&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re the ones. How&rsquo;d you like to help
catch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;&rdquo; The boy stared. Then of a sudden
he started talking rapidly in a strange language.
His two beefy companions listened
with popping eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll do it, all right,&rdquo; Drew whispered to
Johnny. &ldquo;Got to! Between the devil and the
deep blue sea, they are. Go to jail for poaching
or help catch crooks. What would you
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; the strange boy said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya. We do,&rdquo; one of the men agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now we are five,&rdquo; Drew exulted.
&ldquo;Not a bad lot,&rdquo; he mumbled to Johnny. &ldquo;Just
ignorant and hungry. Good shots, too, I&rsquo;ll bet
on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny took a long breath. All that suspense,
and the kidnapers still some distance
away! He felt very much like an empty sack.
But he must carry on. Shaking himself, he set
his teeth hard. &ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once again they plunged into the night.
Now they were five men and two boats.</p>
<p>And all the while the mysterious flashlight
was making its way along the shore, coming
from the opposite direction toward Baley&rsquo;s
cabin which might, Johnny believed, be the
scene of a bloody battle within the hour.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>This time, after a careful study of the situation,
Drew decided that the journey should
be made entirely by water. The island was
narrow, the boy moose hunter explained. A
dock virtually formed a door step to the cabin.
One had but to reach that dock, and he was
at the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows lead the way,&rdquo; Drew commanded.
&ldquo;Not too fast. Watch your oars. Not
a creak from them. Keep your oarlocks damp.
And don&rsquo;t talk! Not a whisper! If these men
get the drop on you, whang! You&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya. We do,&rdquo; the older of the men agreed
hastily. Johnny noticed that his knees were
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good shock troops,&rdquo; was his mental comment.
&ldquo;No good for a real scrap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A half hour of breathless suspense, and they
were gliding along the island&rsquo;s short shore
line, nearing the dock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Drew had driven their boat alongside
the others. &ldquo;You fellows fall back. We&rsquo;ll
take the lead. Wherever we go, you follow
close!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They caught this whispered command, fell
back, then followed on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Drew had driven their boat to the very side
of the dock, and was in the act of creeping toward
the prow, when he paused to hiss:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No need for this command. Johnny&rsquo;s keen
ears had caught it, the most unearthly sound
heard on land or sea&mdash;a hollow chuckle that
fairly dried the marrow in his bones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-what is it?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; Drew was creeping forward
once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Light in the cabin,&rdquo; came back to Johnny
faintly. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re there all right. We&rsquo;ll creep
up on &rsquo;em. Get the drop if we can. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again came that hollow chuckle. &ldquo;As if it
came from an empty cabin.&rdquo; Johnny shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All set. Come on.&rdquo; Hollow chuckles meant
little to Drew Lane.</p>
<p>Forgetting the moose hunters at their backs,
they crept across the short stretch of planking
that led to the cabin door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>Johnny thought he heard his heart&rsquo;s wild
beating. Some creature, small and very fast,
shot across the way before them. It was with
the utmost difficulty that he kept his lips
sealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s hand was on the knob. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
throw the door open. You cover &rsquo;em. Shoot
if they make a false move. Kidnapers have
little claim on life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the door is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny did not finish. The door was open.
He found himself standing beside Drew in the
dark; the candle light of the room was gone.
Two bulky figures stood before them. On the
table something bright gleamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guns!&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>Astonishment all but overcame him as he
realized that their presence was not even suspected.
Then men were standing with their
backs to them.</p>
<p>It took but one glance at the window in
the opposite wall to discover the cause of this
unheard-of suspense. Outside the window was
a grinning, gleaming skull. And even as Johnny
saw it there came again that unearthly
chuckle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>Quite as paralyzed as those before him,
Johnny stood open-mouthed, staring.</p>
<p>It was Drew Lane who broke the spell. &ldquo;All
right there!&rdquo; His tone was smooth and cold
as ice. &ldquo;You, Tony Piccalo, and you, Spike
O&rsquo;Connor! Just reach for the sky! And if
you can&rsquo;t get it, just keep on reaching!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With one hand he held his own automatic,
with the other he was removing the gangsters&rsquo;
weapons to his own pockets.</p>
<p>The men whirled about. For a second silence
too deep for words hung over the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; one of the men grumbled.
&ldquo;You got us. We don&rsquo;t fight spooks. That was
the Galloping Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in ghosts.&rdquo; Drew switched
on his flashlight. &ldquo;Now, then, you fellows sit
right down there in the corner, and I&rsquo;ll tell
you what we want you for, and why.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; His voice changed as his
eyes roved the room. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Red Rover
and that girl, Berley Todd? Come, now!
Quick! Where are they?&rdquo; The steel in his
gun was not harder than the ring in his voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Honest&mdash;&rdquo; The man known as Spike
O&rsquo;Connor, a bad one according to his own previous
estimation, was shaking. &ldquo;Honest, we
don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s finger trembled at
the trigger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact!&rdquo; the other man put in hastily. &ldquo;Got
away from us, they did, more&rsquo;n three days ago.
We sent out a man to look for them. He didn&rsquo;t
come back. We sent out two more. They
didn&rsquo;t come back. I tell you, this island gets
&rsquo;em! Ghosts and all that.&rdquo; The way this bad
man trembled was good to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I might be able to help you,&rdquo; came
from the doorway. Johnny whirled about to
find himself staring into a pair of friendly eyes
that gleamed beneath a ten-gallon hat. Ed,
the scout, had caught up with them at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been with me until to-night, the
Red Rover and Berley Todd have.&rdquo; The scout
advanced to the center of the room. &ldquo;Now
unless that squall we had an hour or two ago
took &rsquo;em out to sea, they should be on Passage
Island where there are civilized human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Drew, spinning about,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got to fly over to Passage Island. And
that on the double quick! Can&rsquo;t let this get
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this Passage Island?&rdquo; he demanded
of the scout. &ldquo;Can a fellow land there in a
sea plane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four miles off Blake&rsquo;s Point. Land on the
lee side all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Johnny, slip these on &rsquo;em.&rdquo; He dangled
two pairs of handcuffs. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a little
crowded with four of us in the red racer, but
we&rsquo;ll make it. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to stare at the doorway. Standing
there was a very tall and very thin young
man in a tight-fitting suit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmie Drury!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you
come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walked, old son. Walked. How&rsquo;d you suppose?&rdquo;
Jimmie Drury, reporter for the News,
grinned from ear to ear. &ldquo;Worth it, too!
Grand story. Good old scoop!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough story,&rdquo; Drew grumbled.
&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll not shoot it till I tell you when.
I&rsquo;ll tell you about that later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re off for Passage Island,&rdquo; he grinned.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll walk there, too, I suppose; just four
miles of Lake Superior. And they tell me Superior
never gives up her dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there, never fear!&rdquo; Jimmie laughed.
&ldquo;Sooner than you&rsquo;d think! Before you arrive,
perhaps. Who knows?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>

<br />&ldquo;PLAY BY PLAY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>At one o&rsquo;clock the next afternoon the cement
seats of Soldiers&rsquo; Field, where seventy
thousand spectators were to witness a
football classic of unparalleled interest, began
filling up. The place had been sold out for ten
days. Even before the Red Rover vanished
every ticket was gone. There were several reasons
for this. It was a charity game; the entire
net proceeds of the game were to be expended
on the city&rsquo;s needy. It was the great
game of the year. The rivalry between Old
Midway and Northern had ever been keen,
never keener than now, for this game was to
decide the championship of the conference.
The Red Rover was to play, and it had been
rumored abroad that this would be his last
game, that he would not return to his squad
in the following autumn. It was to be the Old
Midway coach&rsquo;s last game. He had definitely
retired. And those who loved the Grand Old
Man of football were legion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">[290]</div>
<p>So here they were gathering early. Some
coming from afar had arrived early. Some,
fearing that the place had been oversold, were
hastening to secure their seats.</p>
<p>All morning there had been a whisper
abroad. &ldquo;The Red Rover will play to-day.&rdquo;
Thus the whisper ran. One heard it on the
street corner, behind the counters in department
stores, in the corner cigar store. When
the over-curious rang up a newspaper office
they were greeted by a curt denial. &ldquo;We know
nothing of it. Wish we did!&rdquo; Bang! went the
receiver. The phones of Old Midway&rsquo;s office
rang constantly. &ldquo;No! No! No!&rdquo; the patient
clerks repeated over and over. &ldquo;He has not
returned to Old Midway.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">[291]</div>
<p>So over that great city expectancy hung like
a thin cloud. And the early arrivals on the
field whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the office beside the lighthouse on far
away Passage Island sat Drew Lane and
Johnny Thompson. Whatever else happened,
they would not see the game. There were two
others who would not see that game. Tony
Piccalo and Spike O&rsquo;Connor sat moodily in
the far corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some time before the game,&rdquo; Drew
commented dryly, casting a significant glance
at a radio that stood against the wall. &ldquo;Just
about time for a little story. You&rsquo;ll be interested
in this.&rdquo; He turned to Johnny. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
guessed at a part of it. Now it all may be told.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows&mdash;&rdquo; He addressed himself to
the others. &ldquo;You fellows are not kidnapers by
profession. Give the devil his dues. But for
all that, the fellow who stoops to kidnaping
in order that he may gain an end just once is
lost, or should be. It&rsquo;s the lowest crime on the
docket, the least romantic, the most cowardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You,&rdquo; his voice rose, &ldquo;are professional gamblers,
and that rates you pretty low, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">[292]</div>
<p>He turned to Johnny. &ldquo;You see, what happened
was this. These fellows, with Tony&rsquo;s
brother, Angelo, have been operating a gambling
den beneath Angelo&rsquo;s flower shop for a
long time. Race track stuff, baseball pools and
all that. Somehow we didn&rsquo;t get next to them
until you found that jimmy bar that lifted the
Red Rover&rsquo;s window, and the shoe that made
the invisible footprint was brought in by the
Rat. Then we began to suspect something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you brought in that batch of shavings
from Angelo&rsquo;s favorite pocket knife and
we found they matched those made near the
scene of the kidnaping; when you told us about
being thrown from that room beneath the
flower shop, we knew we were on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pair of culprits sat listening in stolid
silence. Johnny heaved a sigh. So he had been
useful in this search. He was glad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found out in no time at all,&rdquo; Drew went
on, &ldquo;that these birds had organized a football
pool. They were betting on a grand scale on
to-day&rsquo;s game, giving all manner of odds. And
why not? You cowards!&rdquo; He shot a look at
the corner of the room. &ldquo;You knew all the
time that you meant to kidnap the Red Rover
and hide him on Isle Royale until the game
was over.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">[293]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The game.&rdquo; His voice dropped. &ldquo;The game
has not yet started. The kick-off is at two
o&rsquo;clock. And such a game as it will be!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he turned again to Johnny,
&ldquo;when we knew what you had discovered, the
rest was easy. Tony, here, is a licensed pilot
and owns that big amphibian. Owns it!
Strange what some men will do to get more
money when they are already rich! But crooked
money calls for more and more, always
more and more. That&rsquo;s why a crooked dollar
is such a terrible thing to possess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since Tony had that plane and he had been
at Isle Royale last summer, as young Angelo
told you, as soon as we saw that clipping about
the mysterious plane over Isle Royale, we
knew just where to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the rest.&rdquo; He smiled at Johnny.
&ldquo;How we found them and got them, how we
flew here in the red racer just in time to prevent
the broadcasting of our great discovery.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">[294]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t know, and what these fellows
don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rdquo; his eyes snapped,
&ldquo;is what is about to happen down there in the
city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be a football game played. Right!
The Red Rover will play. He&rsquo;ll win!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here comes the kidnapers&rsquo; reward.
Some crooks get to jail rich. They beat the
rap or go free in two years, still rich. None of
that here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned once more to the corner. &ldquo;You
fellows, you and your associates have bet your
last dollar on the team that was to defeat Old
Midway because of your crookedness. We
know where all that money is stored. That
team will not win. My pal, Tom Howe, and
plenty more cops are ready to see that every
dollar you wagered is paid. And
then&mdash;&#8203;you&mdash;&#8203;will&mdash;&#8203;be&mdash;&#8203;broke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A groan came from the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that&rsquo;s too tough!&rdquo; Drew leaped
to his feet. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not! Nothing is too bad for a
kidnaper.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">[295]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Tony!&rdquo; He pointed a finger.
&ldquo;You kidnaped that Berley Todd, a defenseless
girl, because you could, and because you
thought you could pull down twenty extra
grand for yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be cheering on the side lines.&rdquo; He
laughed a happy laugh. &ldquo;That little girl will
be cheering for the Red Rover, the best sport
that ever lived. And you fellows are going to
sit right in this room, getting the radio report
and hearing yourselves go broke play by play.
<i>Play by Play!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">[296]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXII</span>
<br />&ldquo;70,000 WITNESSES&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As Johnny listened to Drew Lane&rsquo;s rapid-fire
report of events and their outcomes,
he realized that he had played no small part
in the breaking up of a notorious band of gamblers
and the thwarting of their plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More luck than skill on my part,&rdquo; he whispered
to himself.</p>
<p>Just then a thought struck him with the
force of a blow. What if the gamblers&rsquo; plans
had not been thwarted after all? Had Drew
Lane talked too soon? How could they know
that the Red Rover had reached the city safely?
Hour by hour, with monotonous regularity
the radio reported: &ldquo;Still missing.&rdquo; Was
he still missing? Would he fail to appear when
the team lined up for the kick-off?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">[297]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll know that soon enough.&rdquo; He glanced
at the clock on the wall. &ldquo;Twenty minutes
more, and then&mdash;&rdquo; He took a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means so much!&rdquo; He all but prayed.</p>
<p>Then again doubt assailed him. Suppose the
Red Rover <i>had</i> reached the city; suppose he
did line up with his team? He had been away
from practice for days; had missed all the elaborate
plans made for this game of games. He
had not lived as players live who are training
for a major event. &ldquo;And every one feels that
if he were only there the game would be won
before the kick-off!&rdquo; He fairly groaned.</p>
<p>Once again he glanced at the clock. &ldquo;Fifteen
minutes to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With nervous fingers he snapped on the
radio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are,&rdquo; the announcer was saying.
&ldquo;The seats are rapidly filling up. The aisles
are packed. What a picture! Gay sport costumes;
bright banners; pennants waving;
bands playing. Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out from the radio came the stirring notes
of a march.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">[298]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There! There!&rdquo; the announcer shouted into
the microphone. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re coming out now.
The players are coming on the field. There&rsquo;s
Old Midway. Number twenty-one, Masters,
the giant fullback; eighteen, Dwyer, right
half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny caught his breath. Was it known
by now? Would Red come upon the field?
His number was twenty. Would he hear it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-eight, Sullivan, the slim quarterback,&rdquo;
the announcer recited. &ldquo;Seventeen,
Clarke, the center; and now Johnson, the left
half, who as you know, replaces the famous
All-American star, Red Rodgers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny heard no more. His hopes sank.
From the corner came an exultant whisper.</p>
<p>But the whisper came too soon. Jimmie
Drury, the slender reporter from the News,
had carried the Red Rover and his diminutive
companion, Berley Todd, speedily and safely
from the enchanted isle back to the city. After
landing in an open field close to the city, they
tramped into the suburbs and registered under
assumed names at a small hotel. Jimmie
made no effort to get in touch with his paper.
In his pocket he carried a story that would
have made the first page in every newspaper
of the land. &ldquo;The Red Rover has been found.
He is safe. He will play.&rdquo; He could see it
across the page in glaring letters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_299">[299]</div>
<p>The story was not told. Jimmie was loyal,
loyal to the core. Drew Lane had told him
what to do. He would do it, cost what it
might.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These men,&rdquo; Drew had said sternly, &ldquo;must
not know. They must pay in full for their
greed and for their cowardly deeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they shall pay!&rdquo; Jimmie had agreed.
So it came about that just as the ball was
being placed for the kick, a youth whose shining
new suit bore the number twenty came
trotting out to say a word to the referee, then
to tap number fourteen on the back and to
mumble apologetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Johnson. Better luck next time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the Red Rover.</p>
<p>From the vast throng there came a sound
like the wind flowing through the tops of a
thousand trees. They had seen that number.
Were they to believe their eyes?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_300">[300]</div>
<p>The sigh, the whisper, grew to a shout.
Then the sons and daughters of Old Midway
leaped to their feet and such a cheer rent the
air as was echoed back again and again by the
distant skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Hearing this, Red Rodgers felt a chill rise
up his spine. They had seen him. They expected
so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I lose,&rdquo; he murmured low, &ldquo;if I lose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set his teeth hard. He could not, he must
not lose!</p>
<p>On far away Passage Island Johnny Thompson
and Drew Lane heard the shout that,
growing in volume, came welling forth from
the radio like the increasing roar of a raging
sea. They heard it and understood. And from
the corner where the kidnapers sat there came
again a low groan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_301">[301]</div>
<p>At this moment Johnny was tempted to
feel sorry for these men who had lost so much.
&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;a week ago they
were riding in powerful cars purchased by
crooked money. They wore diamonds. Nothing
was too good for their ladies; furs, silks,
jewels. They denied themselves nothing.
Then, that they might win still greater wealth,
they kidnaped a boy who had nothing, who
was working his way through college.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time they snatched a defenseless
girl. These they would have murdered
had it served their purpose. They know no
mercy. They deserve none. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; came the announcer&rsquo;s shout from
the radio. &ldquo;Look! There&rsquo;s the Red Rover!
Can you beat that? You can&rsquo;t even tie it! He
was kidnaped, as you know, several days ago.
The country has been gone over with a fine-tooth
comb. They couldn&rsquo;t find him. Every
detective in the country was on the trail of the
abductors. And now he walks calmly out on
the field to take his place. It can&rsquo;t be the Red
Rover. It must be his ghost. And yet&mdash;yes,
it is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen to that crowd roar! They&rsquo;re standing
up. All over the stadium they&rsquo;re on their
feet. Even Northern is applauding. Good
sports! What a game this is going to be!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">[302]</div>
<p>And it was; such a game as one witnesses
but once in a lifetime. And yet, as Drew Lane
and Johnny Thompson sat there in that room
on Passage Island, looking away now and then
to the tossing waters of Lake Superior, listening
always with all their ears, they sank
lower and lower in their chairs. Something
seemed to be wrong. The Red Rover could
not get going. Midway&rsquo;s hopes had been centered
on him. The team had been built around
him. A strong offensive team, able to charge
the line, to block and to run; yet always as he
followed through the opening made for him,
some one from the opposing team broke
through and downed him. Sometimes they
smeared him for a loss.</p>
<p>Red could not understand this himself. Had
the opposing players schooled themselves so
thoroughly in defensive tactics that no man
could go through for a touchdown? In the
days away from his team had he grown soft?
He hated those kidnapers with a bitter hate;
was tempted even to hate old Ed, the scout,
Berley Todd and Drew Lane.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_303">[303]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no!&rdquo; he grumbled to himself once, as
he lay sprawled upon the turf during &ldquo;time
out.&rdquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our
stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.&rsquo;
I&rsquo;ll blame no other one than myself. I&rsquo;m not
so good. But this once I must win. I must!
I <i>must</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But could he? On the defense his team acquitted
itself well. During the first half not a
touchdown was made on either side.</p>
<p>Then, at the very beginning of the second
half catastrophe befell them. Midway kicked
off. Northern carried the ball to Midway&rsquo;s
forty-yard line. A forward pass was completed,
a second following in quick succession.
One mad plunge, and Northern went over for
a touchdown. Their fans went mad. The kick
for an extra point was successful. The score
stood Northern 7. Midway 0.</p>
<p>Gloom, deep and ominous, settled down
upon the room out there on far away Passage
Island. Gloom, but not for all. From the corner
came in a loud whisper:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">[304]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Tony. We are going broke play by play.
Just like he said, play by play.&rdquo; This was followed
by a hoarse chuckle that made Johnny&rsquo;s
blood boil. If Drew Lane heard it he did not
show it by so much as the flicker of an eyelash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he believe that the Red Rover can
still go through to victory?&rdquo; Johnny asked
himself.</p>
<p>Then, as if what appeared almost sure defeat
were not enough, at the middle of the third
quarter one more terrible thing happened.</p>
<p>To Drew and Johnny it appeared all the
more terrible since, receiving it on the radio,
they could but half understand what was going
on. &ldquo;Now play will be resumed,&rdquo; the announcer
droned. &ldquo;The men are taking their
positions. Northern has the ball on their own
forty-five yard line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crowd is on its toes. Seventy thousand
people. Bright blankets, fluttering flags. Plenty
of color out here. Plenty of noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvelous day. Clear as glass. Not a cloud.
Snappy. Just the kind of day that makes them
fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now they&rsquo;re lined up. Now&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">[305]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Oh!&rdquo; There came a sudden change in
the announcer&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s happening
down there. A player comes racing onto
the field. He&rsquo;s leaping at some one. Looks like
the Red Rover. It <i>is</i> the Red Rover! What do
you make of that? Two men of Old Midway
fighting it out before seventy thousand witnesses!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a tall youth in black leaps in. They&rsquo;re
piling up. What a scrap!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the corner of a room up there on Passage
Island Tony and Spike stirred uneasily. Johnny
leaned far forward as if he would drag more
words from the radio. But for a time it was
still. Deep silence fell in the room. Drew
Lane, keeping a wary eye on his prisoners,
waited for more.</p>
<p>The thing that had happened there on Soldiers&rsquo;
Field was scarcely to be credited. Tom
Howe, who had appointed himself bodyguard
for the Red Rover, had been seated on the
bench near the door leading from Old Midway&rsquo;s
dressing rooms. A youth in a brand new
uniform had walked out from that door, had
stood quite still for a moment, studying the
field.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_306">[306]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Looking for some one,&rdquo; Tom told himself.
Then he got a good look at the man&rsquo;s face, and
caught his breath. This fellow seemed old for
an under-graduate. There was about that face
a suggestion of long nights and dissipation
such as one does not see topping a varsity
football uniform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a tin horn gambler!&rdquo; Tom rose
slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>Next instant the stranger went trotting toward
the field. It was a nervous trot. Nothing
nervous about the man that followed him, Tom
Howe.</p>
<p>Of a sudden, as he neared the group of players,
the man in the football suit, flashing a
knife, leaped at Red Rodgers.</p>
<p>Tom Howe was light and quick. With a
panther-like leap he was upon the mysterious
assassin.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_307">[307]</div>
<p>Down they went. Rolling over and over,
they strove for possession of the knife. Now
Tom had it. Now it was wrenched from his
grasp. Now he gripped the other&rsquo;s wrist. He
was fighting with the power of desperation,
this stranger. Prison bars yawned for him. He
knew prison. He had been there.</p>
<p>Now by sheer strength he forced Tom&rsquo;s arm
back until the point of the knife was within an
inch of Tom&rsquo;s good right eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; hissed the dark assassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; Tom set his teeth hard.</p>
<p>All this happened in the space of seconds.
Then a terrific blow from the right sent the
dark stranger rolling over the earth. His knife
went spinning high in the air.</p>
<p>The Red Rover had seen. He had understood.
He had struck.</p>
<p>Leaping once more upon the stranger, Tom
dragged him to his feet. &ldquo;You would!&rdquo; he
hissed. &ldquo;One more of those &lsquo;seventy thousand
witnesses&rsquo; stunts. But it don&rsquo;t go. The hoosegow
for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led him from the field.</p>
<p>Just how much of all this the vast throng
understood would be hard to say.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">[308]</div>
<p>All that Drew and Johnny got over the radio
was a brief account of a more or less mysterious
fight on the gridiron. They were
shrewd enough to understand that an attempt
had been made upon the Red Rover&rsquo;s life and
that quick-witted Tom Howe had saved the
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved!&rdquo; Johnny breathed. &ldquo;Saved! But the
score is still 7 to 0. Wonder how a football
player behaves after an attempt has been made
upon his life.&rdquo; He was to see.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">[309]</div>
<h2 id="c33"><span class="small">CHAPTER XXXIII</span>
<br />THE FLEA FLICKER</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Paying me a compliment,&rdquo; Red grumbled
to himself, as the third quarter
ended with no success. &ldquo;Tried to kill me, that
tough egg sent by Angelo and his gang. As
if I&rsquo;d do them any harm playing football!&rdquo; He
was thoroughly disgusted with himself. What
was the trouble? He could not get going, that
was all. And the game was slipping away, with
one more quarter to play.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter began as the third had
ended, with the two teams driving one another
back and forth across the field. Eleven precious
minutes of play passed into eternity. Still
no score. And then came a change.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">[310]</div>
<p>From time to time, as the teams moved toward
the center of the field, Red had stolen a
glance at Berley Todd. She had not been
home. Apparently this game was, for the time,
all that mattered. As the young football star
thought of this a lump rising in his throat all
but choked him.</p>
<p>Somehow Berley had secured a place directly
behind the rail in the first tier of seats. Every
time Red stole a glance at her he found
her sitting there, sober-faced, tense, expectant.
She did not leap and scream as others did. She
did not join in the shouting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d almost say she was praying,&rdquo; Red told
himself. &ldquo;Wonder if any one ever prayed at
a football game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely if ever there was occasion for sober
thoughts over a ball game, this was the time.
A thousand, five thousand, perhaps ten thousand
foolish men had been tricked into gambling
on what they believed to be a sure thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t care for them,&rdquo; Drew Lane had
said. &ldquo;If they were the only ones to suffer they
should lose. But if they <i>do</i> lose, their families
will suffer; women and children. So Red, you
must fight! Fight! <i>Fight!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">[311]</div>
<p>He <i>had</i> fought. But all in vain. Somehow
he could not get into the game. The very
weight of responsibility seemed to crush the
spirit out of him.</p>
<p>Then, four minutes before the end, a strange
thing happened. He was beyond the center of
the field on the enemy&rsquo;s territory. There was
&ldquo;time out.&rdquo; He heard a thin voice calling. It
was Berley Todd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely as he came
near, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you try the Flea Flicker?&rdquo;
Then she smiled. It was her first smile that
day.</p>
<p>There was something about that smile that
lifted the heavy burden from Red&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Flea Flicker. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had described the play to her while on
one of their wild boat rides before the island.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Flea Flicker. Four minutes to play.
Why not? Why not forget all but the game?
Play for the mere sport of it? Football is sport,
not business. The Flea Flicker, that&rsquo;s it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He joined his team in a huddle. &ldquo;The Flea
Flicker&rdquo; was whispered from man to man. A
ripple of mirth passed over the weary fighters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">[312]</div>
<p>Old Midway had the ball. It was the fourth
down. Four minutes to play. If they lost the
ball they might never regain it. This play was
a complicated one. What did it matter? Win
or lose; the Flea Flicker.</p>
<p>Signals were called. Masters, the fullback,
dropped to the rear in position for a place kick.
Red sank to his knee as if to receive the ball.</p>
<p>The play was on. The ball was snapped, not
to Red but to Masters. Northern players
charged. Dwyer, the right half, ignoring his
man, stood up, facing Masters. Red ran wide
to the right. Masters pitched the ball to
Dwyer. Dwyer tossed it to Red and he was
away.</p>
<p>It was strange, the feeling that came over
Red Rodgers as he leaped forward. He was
not on a football field dodging men, but on
the water, heading into waves that threatened
to swamp his frail craft. There was one to the
right, a huge one. This way out. Here were
two at the left. A quick turn here, a short twist
there, and he was on again. Five, ten, fifteen,
twenty, twenty-five yards, he raced forward.
The field was clear now. The crowd was on
its feet. They were shouting themselves
hoarse. The miracle had happened. The Red
Rover, their idol, was away at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">[313]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo; they screamed.
And at last Berley Todd joined in the cry.
&ldquo;Touchdown! Touchdown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Touchdown it was. Then the crowd waited,
breathless, for the kick that promised a tie or
defeat; the crowd waited and lost, for the ball
went wild. The score stood Northern 7; Midway
6.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes to play,&rdquo; Red muttered to
himself. &ldquo;Two minutes are enough for any
man&rsquo;s touchdown.&rdquo; But were they?</p>
<p>Midway called for &ldquo;time out.&rdquo; As the team
dropped to the ground one word was passed
from man to man.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s rest and they were up again. A
hush fell over the great throng as Northern
sent the ball soaring high.</p>
<p>Watching as a hunter watches a hawk, Red
measured the distance, dashed a clean twenty
yards, gathered the ball in his arms and, never
pausing, sped on toward the goal line.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">[314]</div>
<p>It was strange. Only half conscious of his
opponents, he passed them one by one. As one
leaped at his feet he swerved and sagged far
over. The man missed. Now three were
bunched against him. They formed a pinwheel.
He was at the center of the wheel. They
whirled round and round like sparks. They
flew to right and left of him. Again he sped
on. One man remained. Red leaped at him,
then stopped dead. The man went on his face.</p>
<p>Then, with the thundering roar of a victory mad
throng beating on his ears, he fell across
the line for a touchdown.</p>
<p>Johnny Thompson and Drew Lane, away
up on Passage Island, heard all this, and greeted
one another with a solemn handclasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They try for the extra point,&rdquo; the announcer
called. What did it matter? The
game was won.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_315">[315]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good! What matter? The score stands
13 to 7. One minute to play. Time out. The
Red Rover is leaving the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did it matter? The game was won.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Tom Howe&rsquo;s mop-up men did their work
well. Angelo the impostor and his band of
crooks and kidnapers were sent to jail; not,
however, until their bank accounts were exhausted,
their safety boxes emptied, paying
back the money they had hoped to steal.</p>
<p>With a pilot imported from Houghton,
Johnny rode in the big amphibian with Drew&rsquo;s
prisoners back to the city. Drew rode alone in
the red racer.</p>
<p>As for Red, a cold shower woke him from
the half-trance that had carried him to victory
in one of the famous football games of history.
Two days later he found himself sitting before
a small fire in his own room, meditating on the
future. Berley Todd had urged him to visit
her in her father&rsquo;s palatial home. Would he
go? She had asked him to go with her to Isle
Royale in the good old summer time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isle Royale,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;The land of
dreams.&rdquo; Would he go?</p>
<p>The Grand Old Man was leaving football
forever. Should he, too, leave and go back to
the steel mill? Surely life was strange.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">[316]</div>
<p>A book lay on his lap. It was &ldquo;Burton&rsquo;s
Analytic Geometry.&rdquo; He must dig in. He dug.</p>
<p>The morning after his return Drew Lane
met Jimmie Drury. &ldquo;Jimmie,&rdquo; he demanded,
&ldquo;why did you play the Galloping Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I did?&rdquo; Jimmie grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. Quit your kidding! Own up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s smile broadened,
&ldquo;it happened that I was at a masquerade party
the night the Red Rover was kidnaped. I had
dressed as a ghost. I was on my way home
when the thing broke. Got out of my taxi and
went after the story, just as I was. When the
myth about the Galloping Ghost got out, I decided
to continue the part. You know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know. You helped a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a case like that,&rdquo; said Jimmie soberly,
&ldquo;every man of us must do his best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the story ends. There will be another
called <i>Whispers at Dawn</i>. Will Drew Lane,
Johnny, and the others walk through these
pages? Who can say? Time moves swiftly.
Yesterday&rsquo;s hero is forgotten to-day. To-morrow
brings another. Read and see.</p>
